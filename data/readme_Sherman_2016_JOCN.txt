Stimulus:
A Gabor, titrated to achieve ~78% detection. Participants performed a Gabor detection task. The Gabor was presented in the periphery.
In the centre of the screen a visual search array was presented. On diverted attention trials, participants had to also report the
presence or absence of a target amongst distractors.

Stimulus coding:
0 = Gabor absent
1 = Gabor present

Confidence scale:
Confidence rating from 1 to 4

Manipulations:
This was a 2 x 2 within-subjects design.
- Factor 1: Attention ( full, diverted )
            Under full attention participants ignored the central visual search array.
            Under diverted attention participants performed both the Gabor detection task and the visual search task.
            Attention was manipulated bloc-kwise

- Factor 2: Expectation ( expect target absent, expect target present )
            In 'expect target absent' blocks, 75% of trials were target absent trials.
            In 'expect target present' blocks, 75% of trials were target present trials.
            This was manipulated block-wise.
            Participants were informed of the most likely stimulus class at the beginning of each block.

Condition coding:
 - 1: Full attention, expect target absent
 - 2: Full attention, expect target present
 - 3: Diverted attention, expect target absent
 - 4: Diverted attention, expect target present

Difficulty coding:
Here, difficulty corresponds to Gabor contrast.
For each of the four conditions we had a running staircase to keep detection performance constant across trials.

Block Size:
48 trials per block

Feedback:
None

NaN fields:
No visual search response given (because it was a full attention trial)
