Stimulus Details:
Difficulty:
   Motion coherence
   Four coherence levels presented within each block (0.032, 0.064, 0.128, 0.256)
   The dot generation algorithm employed in this study was based on that of Shadlen and Newsome (2001) and programmed using PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007).
Stimulus: 1 is rightwards, 0 left
Response: 1 is rightwards, 0 left, TIMEOUT indicate no response within 5s
Accuracy: 1 is correct

Confidence scale:
10-20-30-40-50
Post-Decision Wager (uni-directional)
On choosing a direction, participants were required to gamble 10 to 50 points on their answer using a drop-down menu. If the correct direction was chosen, a participant gained the chosen points, and if they chose the incorrect direction, the same number of points was deducted from their accumulated score. Participants were told at the beginning of the experiment that the aim was to earn as many points as possible by the end of the session. Upon making a number selection, a feedback stimulus appeared on the screen informing subjects whether they had answered correctly and the number of points won or lost.

Manipulations: 
Time Out
Most participants were required to respond within 5 seconds (Timeout)
The variable five_s_to indicates the participants who participated under this constraint

Motivation
All participants were asked to earn as many points as possible
Halfway through the experiment, there was a short break for all
Before re-commening the experiment
50% of the participants were told that their points would earn tickets in a lottery for a cash prize (50 euro)
50% were not
cond: Under cond, "Expt" denotes participants who received the lottery instruction, "Control" indicates those who did not
Int.Block:
The variable Int.Block identifies Practice trials ("Practice"), 
trials before the halfway break ("Pre"), 
and trials following the halfway break ("Post").

Block size: 48 trials, 10 Blocks

Feedback: Included

Training: 1 is practice, 0 is not

Additional Information

Subject population: 
The sample consisted of 36 psychology students of National University of Ireland, Galway (age: M = 20.11 SD = 2.78, female 80%). All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision. 94.3% of participants were right handed. 

Response device: Mouse

Experiment setting: Laboratory. 
Participants' eye movements were tracked so they rested their head on chinrest.
The chin-rest was 80cm away from the monitor and 70cm from the eye-tracker. 
The task was performed on a 23 inches screen with the resolution of 1080p and 144Hz refresh rate. The stimuli were displayed on at 3 degree of visual angle. 

Experiment goals: 
(1) Investigate mouse and eye movement during perceptual decisions
(2) Does motivation improve decision accuracy (knowing they can earn more by being accurate)

Main result: Mouse cursor deflection provides additional information on decision processes
Motivation did not improve decision accuracy, but participants were more accurate over time

Experiment dates: Jan-March 2018
