unpublished dataStimulus: 
each word could be an “old”(1) or “new” (0) wordConfidence scale:The confidence scale was described with the question “How confident are you that you will make the right decision?” The alternatives were “I am guessing”, “I am not confident”, “I am quite confident”, and “I am very confident” (1-4).Manipulations: 
Full description of any manipulations used (or indication that there were no manipulations)Participants were asked to remember lists of 18 words, and then to decide which word was presented before (half of the words were new and half of the words were old). In the test session participants were first presented with the first letter of a word to recognise (cue) and rated their confidence that they would make the right decision about the word starting with this letter. Then the actual word was presented and in the end participants responded whether it was presented previously or not (old/new). We manipulated the number of words starting with the same letter. The lists presented to participants were constructed in a way that for 9 words: each word started with a different letter (small size, difficulty: 1), 5 words started with the same letter and 4 words started with the same letter (large size, difficulty: 2).Block size:  Maximum number of blocks was 6 (36 trails in each), however the procedure was run over 3 consecutive days (after another task) and not all the participants took part in all the sessions (so there are between 3 and 6 blocks per participant).Feedback: 
No feedback was given.NaN fields: Deadline on the response.Subject population: Twenty volunteers (3 males), aged 20-35 (M = 24.15, SD = 3.49).Response device: 
KeyboardExperiment setting: 
In lab, small groups, each person in an individual booth.Training: amount of training given prior to the experimentTen training trials.
Experiment goal: The aim was to find put whether informational noise in memory task affects confidence level and impairs metacognitive accuracy (the relationship between confidence and accuracy).Main result: Confidence ratings were higher for items from the Large set (difficulty: 2) compared to the items for the Small set. We did not detect differences between conditions in metacognitive accuracy (analysed with mixed logistic regression).Experiment dates: 2017
