Stimulus
Previously studied (old) and not previously studied (new) english words (words are indicated in the "item" column), "itemno" is a numeric ID for each word.

Confidence scale
5-point scale, (in most cases) verbal numeric response following a verbal binary old/new decision ("pess" vs. "po" for "yes" vs. "no"). 1 indicates the lowest confidence level and 5 indicates the highest confidence level. Values outside that range or "NaN" indicate invalid responses.

Manipulations
The proportion of lures in each test block was manipulated.

Block size
20 items up to 16 blocks ("test_list" corresponds to block number). Only trials with valid recognition responses are included reducing the number of items to slightly below 20 for some test lists.

Feedback
Trial-by-trial feedback.

NaN fields
Only valid responses are included. "study_list" indicates the number of the study list in which a target was studied (set to "nan" for lures). For confidence ratings "NaN" indicates invalid response. 

Subject population
Young adults (19-26 years old).

Response device
Microphone, computer keyboard.

Location of data collection
Computational Memory Lab, University of Pennsylvania, USA.

Language of data collection
English.

Other fields:
finalrecalled: indicates whether this particular item was recalled during a final free recall period prior to the recognition memory test. Not every session included a final free recall period (set to "NA" if no option for final free recall or for lures).
session: session number (ranges between 1 and 20 with each participant contributing a minimum of 7 sessions).
recalled: indicates if the item was recalled in the recall period immediately following the study list (prior to recognition at the end of the session).
