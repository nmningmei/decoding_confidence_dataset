data is from the perceptual task of the above paper including both patient and control group.

Stimulus:
The task is 2AFC, consisting of two displays of 6 Gabor gratings each presented for 85 ms and separated by a 1000 ms ISI. One Gabor in one of the screens has a different contrast from all other Gabors. Participant should indicate whether he observed the odd Gabor in the 1st or the 2nd interval.
if stimulus = 1: the first interval is target
if stimulus = 2: the second interval is target
1-up 2-down staircase was used to keep accuracy level at around 71%

Response:
if response = 1: the first interval is chosen
if response = 2: the second interval is chosen

contrast_difference:
This columns indicates the difference between the contrast of the odd Gabor and other targets. The lower the contrast_difference, the higher the trial difficulty level.

Confidence scale:
confidence rating was on a 6-point scale using numbers 1 (very unsure) to 6(very sure).

Subject population:
All subjects were male.
'Patient' group were individuals with opiate dependence under methadone maintenance treatment
'Control' group were healthy individuals with no addiction history

Manipulations: 
None

Block size:
Two blocks each with 90 trials (180 trials in total). All subjects finished all 180 trials.

Feedback:
None

Response device: Keyboard

Experiment goal:
To compare metacognitive ability in substance dependent individuals with healthy population in the two tasks involving memory or perception. 

Main finding:
Metacognition was significantly impaired in substance dependent individuals specifically in one task (perceptual) but not in the other.
