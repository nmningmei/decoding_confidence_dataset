Stimulus: Stimuli were sinusoidal luminance gratings presented in a circular aperture and averaged with white noise (see Fig 3). A single noisy grating with random orientation was presented and, after a variable delay (0.6 - 12 sec, in 5 linearly spaced steps), subjects saw a new grating that they could rotate with the computer mouse to match the orientation of the target grating. Subjects then rated confidence on a 1-4 scale. 2). "Stimulus" is the orientation (in degrees) of the target and varied between 1-180 degrees, randomly selected on each trial. "Response" is coded between 1-360 degrees, so to compute error, one needs to select the minimum circular distance between Stimulus and Response. This is what is computed in the "Error" variable - negative is counterclockwise error. "Delay" is the delay duration in seconds. All delays were randomly intermixed.

Confidence Scale: the scale ranges from 1 - 4, with one responses explained to the subject as “guessing” and 4 responses explained as “highly confident”.

Manipulations: Half the stimuli (randomly selected) had "High positive evidence" or 
"Low positive evidence" ("Condition" == 1 or 0.5, respectively). Low PE stimuli were derived from high PE stimuli by halving the Michelson contrast of the grating and the noise prior to averaging the two to make the final stimulus (see methods of original paper for more details). 

Block size: Subjects completed 5 blocks of 60 trials each.

Feedback: No feedback was used.

Training: Prior to the main task, a staircase was used to achieve performance around 78% accuracy. The staircase data is not included here.

Note: subject 6 and 7 are missing one block of data, leaving only 240 trials instead of 300. Subject 8 is missing the last 7 trials of the last block.
