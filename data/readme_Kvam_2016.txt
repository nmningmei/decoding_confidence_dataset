Stimulus: Colored dots - participants had to judge confidence that they were pulled from a 2/3 green, 1/3 pink (response = 1) or from a 2/3 pink, 1/3 green (response = 2) pool of dots

Confidence scale: 50 (uncertain) to 100 (certainly correct), in 1% increments. This is adjusted from the original scale, which was 0 (certain green) to 100 (certain pink), based on which side of the scale the response fell

Manipulations: 
  Dot proportion [strength] - the percentage of dots that were one color
  Dot number [weight] - the number of dots that were displayed on the screen (originally per second, but this is quantified in terms of the total number in the data set)

Block size: 20 trials

Feedback: Feedback was given after each trial about whether or not the confidence response fell on the correct side of the scale

Participants: 29 Michigan State University students, 20 female / 9 male, 18-26 years old

Response device: Mouse; confidence responses entered on a radial scale by moving mouse to desired location (e.g., left = 0, up = 50, right = 100). Illustration provided in the paper

Experiment setting: Dark, sound-insulated individual testing booths

Training: 20 practice trials prior to completing the task

Experiment goal: To examine the impact of manipulations of dot proportion and number on confidence judgments

Main result: Dot proportion had a greater influence than dot number on confidence, violating Bayesian / optimal confidence models such that 
participants were under-confident for high dot numbers and high dot proportions
