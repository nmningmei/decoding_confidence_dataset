Stimulus: A low-contrast grating oriented either horizontally or vertically, presented for 0.2 s. 1 means horizontal and 2 means vertical.

Confidence scale: Participants reported both their degree of confidence of being correct as well as visibility of the stimulus after each single trial. Visibility and confidence were measured on a continuous scale ranging from -12 to 12. The scale ends were labelled as "unclear" and" "clear" for the visibility judgment and "unsure" and "sure" for the confidence judgement. 

Manipulations: Orientation of the grating: horizontal vs. vertical; Contrast: 0, 2.2, 3.9, 5, 5.5, 6.9%

Block size: 1 training block and 9 experimental blocks, 42 trials each

Feedback: After incorrect responses only. 

ScaleOrder: Participants reported either visibility first, and then confidence, or the other way round.

Subject population: age 20-30, 4 males, 16 females

Response device: Orientation judgment: Keyboard; Confidence, visibility: Joystick

Experiment setting: lab

Training: 1. block. 1 = training , 0 = main experiment

Experiment goal: To compare visibility judgments and confidence judgments

Main result: visibility judgments and confidence judgments are not interchangeable.
