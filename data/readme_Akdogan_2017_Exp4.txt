Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 146(3), 347-361. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000265These data are from Experiment 4.Stimulus and task:Participants were tested in the temporal reproduction task, in which they were asked to reproduce a previously learned target duration as accurately as possible. Each trial began with the presentation of a predefined target duration (1.5 or 3.0 s, counterbalanced across subjects) that was signaled by a blue square (80 x 80 pixels) centered on a black background. Participants were first prompted to press the spacebar to initiate the reproduction upon which the blue square appeared. They were then instructed to terminate the reproduction by a second key press when they thought the same amount of time as the target duration had elapsed. After the reproduction, participants were asked to report their confidence regarding the accuracy of their temporal estimates on a numerical scale between 1 (low confidence) and 3 (high confidence) by pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard. After providing confidence ratings, participants were asked to judge their temporal estimates in a given trial as being shorter or longer than the target duration by pressing “V” and “N” keys, respectively. Error directionality was coded as “0” and “1” in the data file.Stimulus Columns:Stimulus: Target (to-be-produced) duration, in secondsRT_start: Time to start the temporal production in secondsResponse: The subject’s estimate of the just experienced target duration, coded in secondsConfidence: The subject’s confidence in the accuracy of their temporal judgment, rated on a 1-3 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater degrees of confidence.RT_conf: RT of the confidence rating in secondsErrorDirection: The subject’s report of whether they under- or over-produced the target duration, coded as 0 and 1, respectively. (0: produced duration is shorter than the target duration; 1: produced duration is longer than the target duration)RT_error: RT of the error direction judgment in secondsConfidence scale: 3-point confidence rating scale, 1 = not confident, 2 = somewhat confident, and 3 = confidentError Direction judgment: 0: underproduction, 1: overproductionManipulations: 2 different target durations were used for different subjects. ID 1-21 was tested with 1.5 s and the rest with 3.0 s as the target duration.Block size: 60 trials, 1 block in total. Feedback: Performance feedback was not provided to the participants.Subject population: Healthy young adults studying/working at Koc University (N = 43)Response device: Standard computer keyboard

Training: 4 trials before test trialsExperiment setting: Timing and Decision-Making Lab at Koc University, Istanbul, TurkeyExperiment dates: June-July 2015Experiment goal: To investigate if humans can accurately judge the direction and the degree of error in their time estimates. Special instructions: Participants were encouraged to use the full range of confidence scale and instructed to respond as fast as possible both for confidence ratings and error directionality judgments.
