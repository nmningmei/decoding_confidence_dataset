Basic Experiment Info: This was a dual-task, visual paradigm using a random dot kinematogram. Participants performed a motion discrimination and a color numerosity task, each followed by a confidence rating. In some blocks they would do only one of the two tasks, and in some blocks they would do both at the same time. The dataset has 4 experiments in total, in which we varied a few stimulus parameters (more info available in the citation). The experiments labelled "short" made use of a 300ms stimulus presentation time, while the "long" experiment had a 1500ms stimulus. Experiments labelled as "staircase" used a staircase procedure throughout the whole experiment, while the "constant" experiment used constant stimuli. Experiments labelled "short/constant" and "short/staircase 2" made use of the same participants, although two participants dropped between sessions, so that the "short/constant" experiment has 2 less participants in total than the "short/staircase2".

Stimulus: For the Motion task, stimulus was either moving upwards (1) or downwards (-1) with a certain coherence. For the Color task, there were either more red dots (1) or blue dots (-1) on any trial.

Confidence scale: Confidence rating going from 50 ("guess") to 100 ("certain").

Manipulations: Motion coherence for the motion task, and proportion of red vs blue dots for the color task.

Block size: 30 trials per block, 18 blocks in total.

Feedback: No.

NaN fields: Because of the dual-task and single-task nature of our paradigm, NaNs will be present in the relevant columns (e.g. RTs, confidence, response) for one task (e.g. motion) in the single-condition of the other task (e.g. color).

Subject population: Healthy participants, aged 18-38.

Response device: Keyboard.

Experiment setting: Experiments labelled "short/staircase" and "long/staircase" were conducted in lab, in a social setting (big open plan room with individual booths next to each other). Experiments labelled "short/constant" and "short/staircase 2" were conducted in individual, isolated booths.

Training: 1 block (30 trials) for every condition (single-task color, single-task motion, and dual-tasking).

Experiment goal: Investigating dual-tasks costs in metacognition.

Main result: Metacognition is spared from dual-task costs in our paradigm.

Location of data collection: Experiments labelled "short/staircase" and "long/staircase" were conducted at the Laboratory of Experimental Economics (LEEP), in the Maison des Sciences Économiques of Université Paris 1-Panthéon-Sorbonne. Experiments labelled "short/constant" and "short/staircase 2" were conducted at the Département d'Études Cognitives of the École Normale Supérieure. All the experiments took place in Paris, France, and were conducted in French.
