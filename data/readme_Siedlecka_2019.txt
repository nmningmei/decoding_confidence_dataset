Stimulus
The stimuli were Gabor gratings oriented towards left (-45 degrees) or right (45 degrees), embodied in a visual noise, presented in the centre of the screen on a grey background. The visual angle of the stimuli was around 3°. The calibration procedure was used to estimate the stimulus contrast resulting in about 70% of correct discrimination response. All trials began with a blank presentation (500 ms), followed by a fixation cross (500 ms). The grating embedded in white noise was presented for 33 ms. Participants were asked to respond whether the grating was oriented towards the left or the right side. 

Confidence scale
We used PAS scale, with the following question: 'How clear your experience of stimulus was?' and the options were: ‘no experience’, ‘a brief glimpse’, ‘an almost clear experience’, and ‘a clear experience’ (1-4). The meaning of the individual scale points was explained in the instruction. The description of each point was based on a guide by Sandberg & Overgaard (2015) with some modifications related to the characteristics of stimuli that were relevant in this experiment (i.e. “no experience” was associated with no experience of the Gabor stripes, but “a brief glimpse” with an experience of “something being there” but without the ability to decide the orientation of the stripes).

Manipulations
Two within-subject conditions were introduced: with and without accuracy feedback. Participants were asked to respond to the discrimination task and then to use PAS. In feedback condition information about discrimination accuracy was presented after PAS rating. 

Block size
There were 2 experimental blocks with 200 trials in each.

Feedback
We manipulated the presence of feedback.

NaN fields
NaNs in Response and Confidence are due to participants not making the reaction in time provided.

Subject population
Thirty seven healthy volunteers (7 males), aged 22 (SD = 2.88). 

Response device
Computer keyboard.

Experiment setting
Small groups, each person in individual booth.

Experiment goal
We tested the hypothesis that perceptual awareness judgments are sensitive to the results of performance monitoring, and specifically to internal or external accuracy feedback about previous behaviour. We expected that reported awareness level would be affected by the accuracy of the previous trials, especially in blocks with feedback information. Specifically, we hypothesised that awareness ratings would decrease after erroneous trials.

Main result
The results showed that visual awareness judgments are related to the accuracy of current and previous response. Participants reported lower stimulus awareness for incorrectly versus correctly discriminated stimuli in both conditions, but also lower awareness level in correct trials preceded by trials in which discrimination was incorrect, compared to trials preceded by correct discrimination. This difference was significantly stronger in Feedback condition. Moreover, in Feedback condition we observed “post-error slowing” for both discrimination response and PAS rating.
