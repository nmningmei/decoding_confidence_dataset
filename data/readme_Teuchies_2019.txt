Stimulus:
Priming arrows that pointed either leftwards (L) or rightwards (R). 
These were preceeded by masked priming arrows that either pointed in the same direction (Congr), in the other direction (Incongr), or by neutral arrows (Neutr), as indicated by the column 'Congruency'.

Confidence scale:
"How much difficulty did you experience when responding to the arrow?"
Continuous scale from 0 (=most difficult) to 360 (= easiest)

Manipulations
Trials were either congruent, incongruent or neutral, as explained in the stimulus section. 

Block size:
Main: 3 blocks of 72 trials

Feedback:
No feedback was presented during the main task

#other#
NaN fields:
RTs slower than 1.5s were not recorded

Subject population:
University students (mean  age  =  23.77  years,  SD  =  3.20)

Response device:
MR  compatible  response  box for the left/right response. MR compatible optical  track-ball  mouse for the rating.
Note that due to the track-ball mouse and the circular scale, it is unlikely that RT_conf is meaningful here. 

Experiment setting:
MRI scanner

Training:
There was a first training block (48 trials) without confidence reports, and a second training block (48 trials) with confidence reports. The training part took place outside the scanner, and these data could not be located.

Experiment goal:
Show that stimulus (in)congruency affects subjective difficulty ratings, even though the primes were presented subliminally, while recording fMRI

Main result:
see paper

Special instructions:
'Use  the  entire  scale' and 'the  extremities  of  the  scale  represent  your  personal  most  difficult  and  easiest  points'

Experiment dates:
2017

MRI scanner, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium (Dutch)
