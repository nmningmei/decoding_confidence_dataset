Stimulus
Indicates old/new status (1 = Old, 0 = New). 'Old' means that the item was previously seen on the study list; 'new' means that it was not previously seen on the study list.

Response
Indicates binary old/new response, which was extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Studied", 0 = "Not Studied".

Confidence scale
Indicates low, medium, or high confidence, extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Maybe", 2 = "Probably", 3 = "Definitely". The 1-6 response scale used by participants was as follows: 1 = Definitely Not Studied, 2 = Probably Not Studied, 3 = Maybe Not Studied, 4 = Maybe Studied, 5 = Probably Studied, 6 = Definitely Studied. The Raw_Response column contains the responses in this format.

Manipulations
There were no manipulations in the experiment.

Block size
There were two study-test cycles; these were completed in two different sessions one week apart. Each cycle contained 48 study items and 96 test items.

Feedback
No feedback was provided.

Subject population
Undergraduate students.

Response device
Keyboard.

Training
None.

Experiment goal
Determine whether response bias on the first test predicted response bias on the second test. 

Main result
There was a strong positive correlation between bias on the two tests.

Experiment dates
February-April 2010.
