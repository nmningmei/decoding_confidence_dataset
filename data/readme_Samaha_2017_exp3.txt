Stimulus: Stimuli were sinusoidal luminance gratings presented in a circular aperture and averaged with white noise (see Fig 5). There were three different tasks in the experiment. 1) Contrast perception (“contrast”), wherein two gratings were presented simultaneously on either side of fixation and subjects judged which location (left or right) contained the grating of higher contrast, then rated confidence on a 1-4 scale. For Task==“contrast”, “Stimulus” denotes which side contained the target: left (-1) or right (1). “Response” uses the same code. 2) Orientation perception (“oriperc”), wherein two gratings were presented simultaneously on either side of fixation and subjects judged whether the two stimuli had the same or different orientation. For Task == “oriperc”, “Stimulus” denotes whether the two orientations were the same (1) or not (0). “Response” uses the same code. 3) Orientation working memory, wherein subjects were shown two gratings separated by 3 seconds and judged whether the orientations were the same or not. For Task==“oriwm”, “Stimulus” denotes whether the two orientations were the same (1) or not (0). “Response” uses the same code.

Confidence Scale: the scale ranges from 1 - 4, with one responses explained to the subject as “guessing” and 4 responses explained as “highly confident”.

Manipulations: there were no other manipulations aside from the trial-by-trial adjustment of the Michelson contrast of the target grating (before averaging with 80% contrast noise) according to an 3-up 1-down staircase. This contrast value is recorded in the variable “Contrast_stair”.

Block size: Each subject completed three blocks of 100 trials for each of the three tasks, resulting in 300 trials per task.

Feedback:  no feedback was used.

Note: subject 7 only complete one block (instead of 3) of the contrast perception task, subject 14 only completed 2 blocks of the contrast perception task.
