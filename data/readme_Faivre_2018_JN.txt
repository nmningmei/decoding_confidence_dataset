Experiments 1-3

Confidence scale: continuous, subjects move a slider with the mouse between 0 (unsure) and 1 (sure I answered correctly)

Feedback: none

Subj_idx: the subject number

Stimulus: stimulus identity (1 ~ more energy on the left, 2 ~ more energy on the right)

Response: subject's response (1 ~ left, 2 ~ right)

Confidence: subject's confidence rating (between 0 and 1)

RT_decision: the decision reaction time (RT in seconds)

RT_confidence: the confidence reaction time (RT in seconds)

Ease: stimulus energy difference between right and left

Subject population: EPFL students (18-35)

Response device: keyboard and mouse

Experiment setting: experimental booth

Training: 10 min prior to the experiment
