Citation: Hetland et al (in prep). Will be uploaded to psyArxiv in autumn 2019 (we run an intervention study to see whether bias and confidence changes, so manuscript is not ready yet)

Stimuli: shapes, words, faces

Fields:
Subj_idx = nominal, continuous numbers from 101 to 149
Stimulus = previously shown image is "seen" (1), new image is "not seen" (0)
Response = seen coded as 1, not seen coded as 0
Confidence = 1: low, 2: high
RT_decConf = response time in sec (confidence given simultaneously with the decision)
Picture ID = test stimulus image (2 images were seen as sample stimuli)
Accuracy = correct response coded as 1, incorrect response coded as 0
Confidence_raw = confidence judgement where 2 = "absolutely sure not seen", 4 = "maybe not seen", 6 = "maybe seen", 8 = "absolutely sure seen" 

Method (concise)
Deese-Roediger McDermott design using words, shapes (from Hillier et al. 2007) and faces (Lundqvist et al., 1997). To assess bias in recognition, we used a modified version of the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger & McDermott, 1995). Participants were given written instructions to pay close attention to a series of faces, shapes or words and try to remember them. There were nine rounds per block. A series contained 12 sample images and five test stimuli. For the face series the sample images were six persons, three male, three female, showing two expressions. The emotional expressions used in the adult series were angry, disgust, happy, sad, surprised and neutral. The adult images were taken from the Karolinska directed emotional face database (Lundqvist et al., 1997). Images were presented long enough for elaborative associations (2000ms). Following each series of images, five images were presented, and participants had to indicate if these images were in the series they had just seen. Answer options were "Definitely seen", "Probably seen", "Probably not seen" and "Definitely not seen". Two of the presented pictures had been in the series, whereas three of them had not. For the face stimuli: Of the non-presented images, one of them was of a seen face, but expressing a not-seen expression. One was of a face not seen, but with a seen expression. The last was of a face not seen with a not-seen expression.

Manipulation: none

Block size: 9 rounds, each round has 12 sample stimuli and 5 test stimuli, so 45 trials per participant. Note: in the study participants do 4 blocks, sitting, after a maximal exhaustion, and during 75% and 85% of their maximal heart rate. Only block 1 (sitting) is provided here
