Stimulus
Indicates old/new status (1 = Old, 0 = New). 'Old' means that the item was previously seen on the study list; 'new' means that it was not previously seen on the study list.

Response
Indicates binary old/new response, which was extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Studied", 0 = "Not Studied".

Confidence scale
Indicates low, medium, or high confidence, extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Maybe", 2 = "Probably", 3 = "Definitely". The 1-6 response scale used by participants was as follows: 1 = Definitely Not Studied, 2 = Probably Not Studied, 3 = Maybe Not Studied, 4 = Maybe Studied, 5 = Probably Studied, 6 = Definitely Studied. The Raw_Response column contains the responses in this format.
