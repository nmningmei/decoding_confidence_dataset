Stimulus: the stimulus is a single, unidirectional, whole-body, passive rotation about an Earth-vertical axis in the dark (vestibular perceptual thresholds). The rotation profile is a single-cycle sinusoid in angular acceleration with a frequency of 0.5 Hz (so each rotation was 2 seconds in duration). The stimulus can be in one of two directions (coded by -1 or 1). What those directions are depend upon the subject's orientation relative to gravity (defined as the "Condition"). Subjects were positioned so the Earth-vertical axis was aligned with their head's "yaw" (seated upright in a chair), "roll" (laying supine, nose towards the ceiling), or "pitch" (laying on their left shoulder, right ear towards the ceiling). For yaw and roll, rotations to the subject's left are coded as -1, while rotations to the subject's right are coded as 1. For pitch, rotations backward for the subject are coded as -1, while rotations forwards forward for the subject are coded as 1. 
-1 = rotations to the negative direction (left/backwards)
1 = rotations to the positive direction (right/forwards)

Confidence scale: 50-100% in increments of 5%. 50% corresponds to just guessing (you can't be less confident than 50%, since there are only two alternatives). 100% corresponds to being absolutely certain. 

Manipulations: There were no manipulations. There were different conditions described below. 

Block size: 100 total trials. Each subject completed 1 block per Condition. Some subject complete more than one Condition.  

Feedback: NO feedback was included. 

Peak Velocity: The magnitude of the rotation stimulus was varied between 6 different levels using the method of fixed stimuli. The magnitude was defined by the peak angular velocity that was reached during the motion. (The profile all of motions was a single-cycle sinusoid in angular acceleration.) The peak angular velocities tested were 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 2, 4, and 7 deg/sec. 

RT: This is because it was not a reaction time task. Instead it was a one-interval direction recognition task. The motion lasted 2 seconds. Subjects were cued (auditory) for the beginning and ending of the motion. They were allowed to respond during the motion. After the motion stopped, they were instructed to respond first with the perceived direction of motion and then their confidence rating. Subject had an unlimited time to respond and were not encouraged to respond quickly or slowly, but typically reported in 1-2 seconds after the end of the motion. Since subjects were not allowed to respond during the motion (like they could in a reaction time task) and were not instructed how quickly to respond after the motion ended, we did not record response time for the direction decision or the confidence. 

NaN: There are NaN fields on a specific trial if the subject reported lapsing and was unable to respond (e.g., microsleep during the trial). 

Subject population: subjects were recruited ages 18-55, but being on a college campus our subjects were typically younger. The age range of subjects was 20-25. All subjects reported no history of vestibular dysfunction. 

Response device: Verbal. Subjects reported verbally over a two-way communication system with the experiment operator, who recorded the responses. Subjects first reported the perceived direction of the motion. For example "left" or "right" (in the pitch Condition, it would be "forward" or "backward"). Subjects were required respond with one of the two option, even if they felt like they had to guess. To confirm their direction response, subjects also pressed one of two buttons (e.g., in their left hand to indicate "left"). Next subjects verbally reported their confidence (e.g., "95 percent"). 

Experiment setting: Laboratory. On a human-rated rotational motion device in the dark.

Training: Subjects were introduced to the types of motions they would experience. Then, first had an opportunity to practice reporting the perceived direction (with some suprathreshold motions to ensure the subject understood the directions correctly). Then subjects were given an opportunity to practice reporting confidence. Training continued until the subject reported they were ready to proceed with testing. This was typically 15-30 training trials. Feedback was not provided on training other than confirmation they were performing the task appropriately.  

Special instructions: Subjects were told that during each trial there will always be a rotation, even if it is very small. Even if you are not sure of the direction, you must choose and press only one button. Just make your best guess.” In addition, they were told: “on average half the rotations are to the left (backward) and half are right (forward). The direction is selected randomly by a computer. This means that previous trials directions have no impact on the next rotation direction. While very unlikely, you could even experience 10 or more rotations in a row in the same direction.”
Regarding confidence reporting, they were provided the following information: “After each trial, after you verbally report a direction and press a button, please verbally report your confidence between 50% and 100%. 50% means you are just guessing. 100% means you are certain. Please report in 5% increments. For example 65% instead of 67.1%.
Further, we told them: “let’s talk a little more about confidence assessment and what you need to do to be "well calibrated." Probabilities are numbers that express uncertainty. If you say that you are 70% confident that you rotated in a direction, you are saying that there are about 7 chances out of 10 that you rotated in that direction. If you answer 100%, that means that you are absolutely certain. If you answer 50%, that means you are just guessing. You can never say less than 50% because you will always rotate in one direction or the other. A key thing that we want you to learn is how to translate your internal feelings of certainty and uncertainty into probability judgments. When you do this task well, we call this being "well-calibrated." We want your confidence to be well-calibrated for this experiment. We would consider you well-calibrated if you were correct 50% of the time that you reported 50% confidence. Again, you would be well-calibrated if you were correct 60% of the time that you reported 60% confidence. And correct 100% of the time that you reported 100% confidence. Critically, confidence reports should not just be you reporting how large the rotation was. You may be very confident in the direction of a small rotation. Or you may be not sure about the direction, even when you know the motion was large. Just report how confident you are in the direction.” 
Regarding the distribution of confidence, we told them: “I want to emphasize that there is no expectation of a certain distribution of confidence assessments between 50 and 100%. The important thing is that for each trial you report the confidence that you experience for that specific trial. This means if you are guessing much of the time, that is OK, and if you are certain most of the time, that is okay too.”
Subjects were asked if they had any questions about the task, their reporting, or confidence prior to starting testing. If any questions were ask, the experiment operator answered them appropriately. 
Subjects were not instructed about how quickly to respond. 
All quotations are instructions that were verbatim read to the subject just prior to the start of the experiment. If a subject completed more than one Condition on a separate session, they were reminded of this information prior to testing.

Condition: As described above, subjects completed the testing in different configurations, which we considered "Condition". Subjects were always rotated about an Earth-vertical axis. But their bodies were positioned so the Earth-vertical axis was aligned with either their head's "yaw" (seated upright in a chair), "roll" (laying supine, nose towards the ceiling), or "pitch" (laying on their left shoulder, right ear towards the ceiling), to yield three different "Conditions". Earth-vertical rotations in these three different configurations stimulate primarily one of each of the three different semicircular canals of the vestibular system, which are responsible for transducing head rotations.
