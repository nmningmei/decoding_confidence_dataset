Stimulus
Pairs of images extracted from a video narrative. 

Confidence scale
4-point scale:  "Very Low", "Low", "High", "Very High"

Manipulations
Participants performed both N task (judge the narrated order of a pair of images, could be treated as a memory task) and C task (judge the chronological order of a pair of images, more like a inference task) in succession. Conditions including whether the task-irrelevant temporal order is congruent with the task-relevant order: Congruent or Incongruent. The task-relevant temporal distance: C task, 3 levels; N task, 3 levels.

Block size
45. 

Feedback
No trial-by-trial feedback was provided.

NaN fields
Subjects were given 6.5 seconds (type 1 task) and 2.5 seconds (confidence ratings) to respond. If subjects failed to respond within this time period, their response was recorded as NaN.

Subject population
Young adults (19-27 years old).

Response device
MRI compatible five-button response keyboard.

Experiment setting
lab; fMRI

Training
No.

Experiment goal
Examine the effect of Congruence. 

Main result
