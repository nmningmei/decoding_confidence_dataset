The dataset comes from Experiment 2.

Stimulus
Gabor patches. For task 1 (coarse discrimination), the Gabor patches were embedded in noise and tilted 45 degrees away from the vertical. For task 2 (fine discrimination), the Gabor patches were tilted slightly (~1 degree) away from vertical. 1: left (counterclockwise) orientation, 2: right (clockwise) orientation.Confidence scale
4-point scale: Subjects were required to report their estimated certainty from 1 (chance) to 4 (perfectly sure). Confidence was given after the decision.
Manipulations
None. The contrast of the Gabor patch (for task 1)and its tilt (for task 2) were varied between the 4 batches of subjects to match average performance across the two tasks.
Block size
20. Subjects completed 4 blocks for each of the two tasks (100 trials per task). 
Feedback
No feedback was given.
Subject population
Young adults. N = 201 (In the analyses, 23 subjects were excluded for poor performance. These subjects are included in the dataset with subject IDs: 179-201)
Response device
Keyboard
Training
No training
