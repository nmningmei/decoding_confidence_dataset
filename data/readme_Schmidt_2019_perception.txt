The experiment evaluates whether metacognition varies post mindfulness training. The dataset is divided as follows: the first 300 trials represent the meditative pre-training evaluation (from trial 1 to 300). From trial 301 are the post-training trials (from 301 to 600).

Two meditative trainings were evaluated: training focused on mental information (MM = mental monitoring) vs. training focused on body information (SoB = Self-Observation of the Body).
