Experiment setting: Web-based.

Experiment goal: Examine whether trial-by-trial (local) confidence contributes to the formation of global self-performance estimates over time.

Manipulations: Perceptual judgements could be either easy or difficult, and either provided feedback (indicated as NaN) or required a confidence rating (provided). Difficulty levels were coded as the dot difference between boxes (DotDiff), with DotDiff=60 indicating an easy trial and DotDiff=24 indicating a difficult trial.

Stimulus: Participants were briefly presented with two black boxes, each containing a number of white dots.

Response: Participants were asked to select the box that contained the more dots (left or right box).

Confidence scale: The rating scale was continuous from “50% correct (chance level)” to “100% correct (perfect)”, with intermediate ticks indicating 60, 70, 80, and 90% correct (without verbal labels). There was no time limit for providing confidence ratings.

Block size: Participants completed 360 trials in total, divided into 30 blocks of 4 to 20 trials, with breaks in-between blocks. All trials are provided (including trials with outlier reaction times that were excluded from analysis).

Feedback: Trials had either feedback (indicated by a NaN in the “Confidence” section) or a confidence rating (but not both).

Subject population: 73 subjects were originally recruited. After application of exclusion criteria, 46 subjects were kept for analysis (16 f/30 m, aged 20–50). Exclusion criteria in Rouault, Dayan & Fleming (2019):
- Responding at chance level and/or
- Always selecting the same rating
- Failing comprehension questions about usage of the confidence scale. Subjects passed if they rated “perfect” performance at least 10% greater than “chance” performance.

Response device: Keyboard.

Experiment dates: December 2017-June 2018.
