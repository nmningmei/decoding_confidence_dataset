Stimulus
The stimuli were 240 Polish six-to-eight letter words (maximum three syllables) chosen from a subtitle-based frequency list (Mandera, Keuleers, Wodniecka, & Brysbaert, 2015). Because the participants’ task was to decide which of the two words had appeared on the list, two alternative versions of the word lists were created. Therefore, each word could be an “old” or “new” word, depending on the list presented to a given participant. Each of the six lists contained 20 words, each starting with a different letter.

Confidence scale
The confidence scale was associated with either the question “How confident are you that you will make the right decision?”, or “How confident are you that you made the right decision?” The alternatives were “I am guessing”, “I am not confident”, “I am quite confident”, and “I am very confident” (Dienes & Perner, 2004).

Manipulations
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions that differed in respect to the task order: either the response to the target words preceded the confidence rating (R-CR, response-confidence rating), or the confidence rating preceded the word-related response (CR-R, confidence rating-response).

Procedure
There were 6 experimental blocks, each started with a list of words presented at the center of the screen for 20 s and was followed by a distracting task consisting of 6 algebra equations, to which participants responded by typing the outcome number. Twenty experimental trials followed, each starting with a cue presented in the center of the screen for 500 ms, being the first letter of a two subsequently presented words. Then participants either performed the decision task (which of the two presented word had been presented before) or rated their confidence.

Block size
There were six blocks - each composed of 20 trials (summing up to 120 trials).

Feedback
No feedback was provided.

NaN fields
Predominantly NaNs are in trials when distractors were presented (so no response or confidence rating was recorded).
NaNs are also present if participants failed to react in given time for either response of confidence rating.

Subject population
Students of Jagiellonian University (Cracow, Poland) recruited through a dedicated system.
Thirty-eight volunteers (27 women) aged 18–30 (M =􏰀 22.47, SD = 2.63).

Response device
Computer keyboard.

Experiment goal
To investigate  whether the order of decision and confidence rating influences metacognitive accuracy.

Main result
Metacognitive judgments are more accurate when measured after response in memory task.

Fields in the .csv file: 

'Subj_idx'  : subject identification number (1 to 38).
'Stimulus'  : 1 - old word on the left, 2- old word on the right site
'Response'  : 1 - left word is the target, 2 - right word is the target.
'Confidence'	: 1 - I am guessing, 2 - I am not confident, 3 - I am quite confident, 4 - I am very confident. 
'RT_dec'	: reaction time of the response, NaN where no reaction was made.
'RT_conf' 	: reaction time for the confidence rating.
'Condition'	: 0 - response then scale (R-CR), 1 - scale then response (CR-R)
'Accuracy'	: 0 - an error; 1 - correct response.
'Block_type'	: 0 - training, from 1 to 6 - experimental blocks (the number indicates a list from which the words were chosen, there were six lists of words, for each participant lists were presented in a different order), 9 - distracting task.
