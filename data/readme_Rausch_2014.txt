Stimulus: A random-dot-kinematogram, with a coherent motion in one out of 360 possible directions. The variable "Stimulus" indicates the direction of motion measured in degrees. 0 means a coherent motion upwards. 

Response: Participants adjusted a clock-hand in the direction of the coherent motion. 

Confidence scale: Visibility of the coherent motion. The two experimental conditions were characterised by two different visibility scales. In one condition, participants rated visibility of the motions using a discrete four point scale; in another condition, participants rated visibility using a continuous scale. The values of both scales ranged from 0-3. 

Manipulations: Direction of motion (one out of 360 possible directions), coherence (i.e. proportion of dots moving consistently in the same direction): 0.016, 0.031, 0.062, 0.125,  0.25,   0.5; Scale (discrete vs. continuous)  

Block size: Training block: 24 trials, followed by 10 experimental blocks of 45 trials each

Feedback: only if the error was greater than 45 degrees of angle

Subject population: age 18-31, 5 males, 15 females

Response device:  direction of motion judgment: joystick; continuous scale: joystick; discrete scale: keyboard

Experiment setting: lab

Training: 24 trials in the beginning

Experiment goal: Compare a standard discrete visibility scale with four discrete categories against a visual analogue scale with labelled ends

Main result: Advantage of the visual analogue scale with labelled scale ends

Special instructions: report orientation of the coherent motion and your degree of experience of the coherent motion as accurately as possible
