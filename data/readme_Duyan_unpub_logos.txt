The study: Scott et al.(2014; https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614553944) showed that subjective confidence can track decision accuracy even when participants are performing at chance level in an Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) task. Furthermore, in a study by Blake, Nazarian & Castel (2015, https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2014.1002798) participants were asked to draw the Apple (c) logo from memory and 83 out of 84 failed to reproduce the logo accurately. Hence, we reasoned that we could obtain chance performance level of accuracy by presenting slightly altered versions of well-known company logos (e.g. changing the color ordering in Google (c) logo) and find out whether a similar pattern of results would emerge.

Stimulus: On each trial, a different company logo was presented. The participants were asked to decide whether the presented logo was the correct/incorrect version. (Stimulus, 1 = correct version, 2 = incorrect version). They were then asked to rate their confidence.

Confidence Scale: The scale was 1-2 with 1 = Not confident, 2 = Confident

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: Participants completed 5 training trials, feedback was provided for these trials.
