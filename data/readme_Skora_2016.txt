Stimulus
Partial report change detection task with rectangles. Stimulus 0 - no change between the two arrays; Stimulus 1 - a change occurred

Confidence scale
Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS - Ramsøy & Overgaard, 2004). Standard categorical version from 1 to 4. Labels translated to Polish.

Manipulations
We manipulated the time between the memory array offset and cue onset. The manipulation was within-participants, however each Condition was in a separate block (Experiment 3). Condition FM (fragile memory), time until cue - 1000 ms; Condition IM (iconic memory), time until cue - 50 ms; Condition WM (working memory), time until cue - 1000 ms but after test array appeared.

Block size
Each participant completed 3 blocks, one for each condition, each block consisted of 120 trials.

Feedback
No.

Subject population
Nineteen participant, 6 males, mean age = 20, sd = 1.33.

Response device
Keyboard. Left hand for scale rating and right hand for detection task.

Experiment setting
Group lab with individual booths.

Training
Fifteen trials of training with the task. Detailed instruction on the task manipulation.

Experiment goal
To test metacognitive sensitivity at different levels of sensory processing.

Main result
As long as all targets were directly cued, they shared the same level of metacognitive efficiency.
