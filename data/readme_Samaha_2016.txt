Stimulus: Stimuli were sinusoidal luminance gratings presented in a circular aperture and averaged with white noise (see Fig 1). There were two different tasks in the experiment. 1) Orientation discrimination (Task == “percept”), where a single noisy grating tilted either 45 or -45 degrees relative to vertical was presented and subjects indicated its tile and then rated confidence on a 1-4 scale. For Task==“percept”, “Stimulus” denotes which orientation was presented: counter clockwise (-45) or clockwise (45). “Response” uses the same code. 2) Orientation delayed-match to sample working memory (Task == “wm”), wherein a single grating ("Load" == 1) or 3 gratings ("Load" == 3) were presented at or surrounding fixation and the subject had to say whether a single grating presented 7 seconds later either matched or not the orientation of the target grating previously presented in the same location. For Task == “wm”, “Stimulus” denotes whether the two orientations were the same (1) or not (0). “Response” uses the same code. 3.

Confidence Scale: the scale ranges from 1 - 4, with one responses explained to the subject as “guessing” and 4 responses explained as “highly confident”.

Manipulations: Half the stimuli (randomly selected) had "High positive evidence" or "Low positive evidence" ("Condition" == 1 or 0.5, respectively). Low PE stimuli were derived from high PE stimuli by halving the Michelson contrast of the grating and the noise prior to averaging to the two to make the final stimulus (see methods of original paper for more details). 

Block size: The perceptual task comprised two blocks of 160 trials each - one at the beginning and one at the end of the experiment. The working memory task comprised 4 block of 60 trials each with load (1 or 3) manipulated block-wise. 

Feedback: no feedback was used.

Training: Prior to the main task, a staircase was used to achieve performance around 78% accuracy. The staircase data is not included here.

NaN fields: note that "load" is set to NaN on perceptual task trails
