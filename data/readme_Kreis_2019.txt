Stimulus: squiggly shapes, continuously varying along 360 degrees

File information

Subj_idx: random 4 digit number
Trial_number: 1 - 30 per participant
Stimulus: type of shape, shapes vary from 0 to 359 degrees, a shape with degree 229 differs from a shape with degree 335. See figure below for shapes (and Zhang & Luck 2009)
Response: 1 if stimulus "remembered", else 0
Confidence: size of the capture are the participant makes, small numbers = high confidence
RT_dec: latency to indicate remembered shape
RT_conf: duration it took to make the confidence judgement
Time_finish: raw time stamp, needed to calculate duration of making the confidence wedge
Response_angle_in_degrees: best guess of which shape was the stimulus (raw value, needed to calculate deviation)
Response_raw_in_degrees: deviation but not yet absolute value taken
RT_start_trial = response time to start the trial, after fixation cross initiating new trial 

Methods from the submitted manuscript:
To measure (meta-) memory, a visual working memory task developed based on tasks used by (Pfuhl, Barrera, Living, & Biegler, 2013) and (Zhang & Luck, 2008) was administered (see figure 1). Every trial began with a one-second long presentation of a sample shape. Upon a self-paced click onto a cross in the middle of the screen, 30 shapes in a circular array appeared and participants had to select the shape that most resembled the sample shape. 
These shapes were generated by drawing lines in a polar plot using the following formula: amplitude(phase) = 10 + amplitude2 * cos(frequency2 * phase + shape) + amplitude1 * (sin(phase) + 1) * sin(frequency1 * phase + phase1) where "phase" describes the angle relative to the reference direction (upwards) and "amplitude" the length (radius) of the vector. The accuracy of a participant's visual short-term memory was measured by the smallest angle between the location of the chosen shape and of the actual target shape where smaller values indicated a more accurate memory representation. 
The confidence of a participant's visual short-term memory was measured as the size of the confidence wedge (in degrees) the participant made.
