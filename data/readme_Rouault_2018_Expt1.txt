Experiment setting: Web-based.

Experiment goal: Examine the relationships between confidence level/metacognitive ability and transdiagnostic psychopathology.

Stimulus: Participants were briefly presented with two black boxes, each containing a number of white dots. The difficulty (DotDiff) corresponds to the dot difference between boxes.

Response: Participants were asked to select the box that contained the more dots (left or right box).

Confidence scale: We used a full 11-point probabilistic rating scale (1=certainly wrong, 3=probably wrong, 5=maybe wrong, 7=maybe correct, 9=probably correct, 11=certainly correct). There was no time limit for providing confidence ratings.

Block size: Participants completed 210 trials in total, divided into 5 blocks, with breaks in-between blocks. Trials with outlier reaction times were not filtered out.

Feedback: No feedback was provided.

Subject population: N=498 participants were kept for analysis when they pass the following tests:A) Prior to the task, a comprehension test was administered regarding the use of the 11-point probabilistic confidence rating scale. Participants were asked where on the scale they should choose if 1) they were sure they made the correct judgement and 2) if they were sure they made a mistake in their judgement. Subjects failed the comprehension test if they answered less than 8 in response to (1) and greater than 4 in response to (2).B) Participants were required to select on an 11-point scale their expected performance level in the task relative to others, together with maximum and minimum expected performance levels. Subjects passed this test if these ratings were transitive, i.e. minimum ≤ average ≤ maximum confidence.C) After completing the experimental task, participants were again asked to rate their expected performance level in the task relative to others; the same inclusion criterion was applied as in (B).D) Subjects with below- or near-chance task performance i.e. <55% correct were excluded.E) Subjects were excluded if they incorrectly responded to a “catch” question in self-report questionnaires.F) Subjects who always selected the same trial-by-trial confidence rating were excluded.For each participant, trials with implausibly slow reaction times of >10s and/or ± 3 SD from the per-subject mean were excluded from the analysis (around 1% of all trials) and are not provided here.
