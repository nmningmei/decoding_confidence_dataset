Stimulus
Indicates old/new status (1 = Old, 0 = New). 'Old' means that the item was previously seen on the study list; 'new' means that it was not previously seen on the study list.

Response
Indicates binary old/new response, which was extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Studied", 0 = "Not Studied".

Confidence scale
Indicates low, medium, or high confidence, extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Maybe", 2 = "Probably", 3 = "Definitely". The 1-6 response scale used by participants was as follows: 1 = Definitely Not Studied, 2 = Probably Not Studied, 3 = Maybe Not Studied, 4 = Maybe Studied, 5 = Probably Studied, 6 = Definitely Studied. The Raw_Response column contains the responses in this format.

Manipulations
Stimulus type was manipulated between subjects. One group studied and was tested on recognition of word stimuli, a second group studied and was tested on recognition of painting stimuli, and a third group studied and was tested on both of these stimuli randomly intermixed.

Block size
There was one study-test cycle containing 96 study items and 192 test items.

Feedback
No feedback was provided.

Subject population
Undergraduate students.

Response device
Keyboard.

Training
None.

Experiment goal
Determine response bias to painting and word stimuli in isolation versus intermixed. 

Main result
Response bias was conservative for paintings whether these were isolated or mixed with words. Response bias for words was roughly neutral when words were isolated, but was liberal when words were mixed with paintings.
