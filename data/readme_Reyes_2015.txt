******************************************************************
Task: Visual Metacognition (see Fleming et al., 2010, Science). No manipulation

Confidence Scale: Continuous, 1 (sure I made an error) and 6 (sure I answered correctly)

Block Size:  320 trials / 8 Blocks 

Feedback: None

Subject population: 27 Chilean Students (18-35)

Training: 80-120 trials prior to the experiment (until the performance reached 71%)

Special Instructions: Respond in less than 2000 ms. Trials with RT_dec > 2000 ms were not analyzed.

******************************************************************
Data:

Subj_idx: The Subject Number
Stimulus: Stimulus Identity (1 = First Scene, 2 =  Second Scene)
Response: Subject's response (1 = First Scene, 2 = Second Scene)
Confidence: Subject's confidence rating (between 1 and 6)
RT_dec: The decision reaction time (RT in seconds)
RT_conf: The confidence reaction time (RT in seconds)
Contrast: Two psychophysical staircases were implemented, which were randomized during the training. Thus, the contrast only varied during the training. The average contrast of the last 6 trials was used as a fixed contrast value for the experiment. Contrast varies from 0.5 in steps of 0.05.
Training: Training (80 trials)= 1 ; Experiment (320 trials) = 0.
