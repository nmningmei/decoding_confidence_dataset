Task description: 
This is a 2AFC metacontrast masking visual discrimination experiment. The target consisted of a square on the left of a fixation cross and a diamond on the right, or vice-versa. Two experiments were done one after the other, the order being randomized. One experiment would consist of real black-filled figures, and the other would consist of illusory Kanizsa-like figures presenting four inducers. The type-1 task consists in discriminating the location of the square to be in the left or the right (while the diamond would be in the opposite side). Participants had to also state whether the figure presented was more or less visible for the general standard of the experiment (this decision depended on the titration of the contrast of the figure or the inducers by using an adaptive staircase protocol). Participants had to press V if the square was on the left and the image was more visible, B if the square was on the left but less visible, N if the square was on the right and less visible, and M if the square was on the right and more visible.

Stimulus: 
Square on LEFT or RIGHT, and diamond on the opposite side.

Confidence scale: 
Subjective visibility was reported with only two alternatives, clear or unclear. Participants had to judge if the target was relatively more or less visible as as compared to how it usually looks across trials.

Manipulations/Task: 
Under the condition "RF" participants had to respond where was the target square and how visible it was. Under the condition "IF", however, participants were presented with illusory Kanizsa squares. The instructions were the same for both types of tasks.

Block size: 
Both tasks would be completed in 3 blocks including 2 short breaks in between. Every block contains 100 trials. To complete the experiment, every participant had to complete 3 blocks for the "RF" condition and 3 blocks for the "IF" condition, totaling 600 trials with 5 short breaks in between blocks.

Feedback: 
Not given.

Subject population: 
22 participants joined our experiment. 13 were male, age 25(5), and 8 were female, age 29(5). 1 was not included due to an important impairment in focusing on the task due to tiredness, this participant did not want to continue with the experiment. 3 more participants were excluded from analyses due to bad overall performance, and a final one due to ceiling effect.

Response device: 
Keyboard.

Experiment setting:
In lab. Participants were seated in front of a computer screen, stabilizing their head with a chin-rest in a darken and silent room.

Training: 
Every participant completed one block of 100 trials for the "RF" condition and one block for the "IF" condition. Additionally, participants first practiced together with researcher on how to respond to the task for less than 50 trials in order to understand how the image usually looks. Every participant would need to continue practicing until the performance on Type1 task reached 70% accuracy and Type2 was above 20% and below 80% in order to help find a reasonable stable contrast value for their beginning of experiment. However, the contrast value would be increased 0.1 or 0.2 in order to help the participant in the first trials of the experiment and stabilize their staircase.

Experiment goal: 
Reaching a similar difficulty level between real and illusory figures, we wanted to explore if metacognitive efficiency would be different.

Main result: 
Although the pattern of results seems to suggest a decrease in metacognitive efficiency for the illusory figure condition, no statistical significance was reached in the comparison. This might imply that metacognitive efficiency is irrespective of the type of figure being perceived, whether real or illusory.

Special instructions: 
Subjects were encouraged to use both subjective visibility rating buttons in about the same number of times since they understood the image would be approximately half of the times more visible and half of the times less visible.

Data collection took place between 4th and 18th June 2019.
