Stimulus: 
Stimuli are squares containing around 200 dots each. The difficulty column is the number of dots subtracted from one stimulus and added to the other. The stimulus column is 0 if there are more dots on the left, and 1 if there are more dots on the right. Responses are coded in the same way (0 = believe there were more dots on the left). 

Confidence scale:
Participants indicate their decision and their confidence simultaneously on a scale that goes from 'sure left' at -50 to 'sure right' at +50. Confidence in the dataset is adjusted so that it reflects confidence in the decision made (i.e. left decision confidence is -1 * confidence), with 1 being minimum confidence and 50 being maximum confidence.

Manipulations:
No manipulations are present in these data. They are the initial decisions taken from a judge-advisor paradigm where the manipulations all occur at the advice point.

Block size:
Blocks were usually 60 trials, but trial_in_block has been included to clarify this.

Feedback:
Feedback was only provided on practice (training) trials. Block-level feedback (% of final decisions correct) was given during non-training trials.

NaN fields:
There should be no NaN fields in these data.

Subject population:
Participants were recruited using the Prolific participant recruitment platform. Demographic data were not recorded. Participants had to have an acceptance rating of >=95% and were only permitted to take part in one of the experiments. 

Response device:
Participants responded using a mouse, although some participants may have completed the study on touchscreen devices such as tablets or phones.

Experiment setting:
Online experiments

Experiment goal:
Paradigm development for a judge-advisor system investigation into whether participants use their own sense of confidence to track the utility of advice when objective feedback is unavailable.

Main result:
As yet inconclusive.

Special instructions:
Participants are asked to use the whole width of the confidence scale.

Link to material/code:

Experiment dates:
Data collected in 2018 across several months.
