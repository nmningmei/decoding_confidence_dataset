Stimulus: The auditory stimuli consisted of Poisson-distributed click trains. Each click was a 23 ms burst of white noise sampled at a rate of 44 kHz. The overall click rate was set to 200 Hz. On each trial, the number of clicks played to each ear varied depending on the ratio of click rates for the correct and incorrect response. The ratio was adjusted on each trial using a 1-up 2-down staircase procedure throughout the experiment, which at the limit converges on 71% accuracy. 
1 = more clicks in left ear
2 = more clicks in right ear

Response: 1 = pressed left arrow key (indicating more clicks in left ear). 2 = pressed right arrow key (indicating more clicks in right ear)

Confidence scale: 1-6, continuous. The scale ranged from 1 on the left (low relative confidence) to 6 on the right (high relative confidence). Participants were asked to use the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor along the scale until they reached a value on the scale that corresponded to how confident they felt about their judgment on that trial. After 3 seconds had elapsed, the participant’s response was recorded. The initial placement of the cursor along the scale was random so that responses were not biased toward any part of the scale. In addition, participants were encouraged to treat the confidence scale as a relative scale, and to use the whole scale throughout the experiment. 

Coherence: This is the inverse of difficulty, and represents the the click rate ratio between the two ears. Higher numbers indicate easier trials (more evidence for the correct answer relative to the incorrect answer). The number of clicks per trial total was 200 and they were distributed between the two ears according to this proportion. For e.g., a coherence level of 0.7 corresponds to 140 clicks to the direction indicated on that trial (see “stimulus”), and 60 clicks to the opposite direction.

Manipulations: None.

Block size: The 180 trials were divided into 3 blocks (60 trials each). Subject were allowed to take a break within blocks.

Feedback: None.

Additional notes: Subjects 3, 10, 11, 13, and 32 were not included in the final dataset in the paper, but are included here for completeness. The first 36 trials (first 1/5th) for each subject were excluded from analyses in the paper, since this is approximately how long it took for the staircase to stabilize. All 180 trials performed by subjects are included here for completeness. 

Subject information: Young adults. For the 35 included in final analyses: 23 F, 12 M, mean age = 22.94, SD = 3.46.

Response device: Keyboard

Experiment setting: In lab, with eye tracking (head fixed with chin rest)

Experiment goal and main result: This study was done to link subjective confidence/uncertainty with pupil dilation. Before the decision was made, pupil dilation was associated with subjective confidence. After the decision was made, the link between confidence and pupil was stronger in participants with better metacognition.

Experiment dates: Data was collected between 4/26/2013 and 7/9/2013.

Location of data collection: New York University, New York, NY.

More methods notes (e.g., timing): The task was a two-alternative forced choice auditory version of the random-dot motion task,  presented using the Matlab Psychophysics Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, MA). At the onset of each trial, participants heard a series of clicks played binaurally through headphones for 1 second. They were then required to decide whether they heard more clicks in the left or right ear. They indicated their judgment by pressing the left or right arrow key on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Participants were asked to keep their eyes on a fixation cross in the center of the screen during stimulus presentation and decision. 3.5 seconds after stimulus onset the confidence scale appeared (if response times were longer than 3.5 seconds, the confidence scale appeared immediately after the response; these trials comprised ~5% of all trials). Participants were asked to use the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor along the scale until they reached a value on the scale that corresponded to how confident they felt about their judgment on that trial. After 3 seconds had elapsed, the participant’s response was recorded. The cursor remained on the recorded confidence response for 0.5 seconds; then the confidence scale disappeared from the screen.After a 1.5-second inter-trial interval, the next trial began (see Fig. 1 in paper for task layout).
