Stimulus
Gratings of 3 different contrasts embedded in noise. The gratings were oriented at 10 degrees away from vertical. 1: left (counterclockwise) orientation, 2: right (clockwise) orientation.Confidence scale
2-point scale: "guess" vs. "certain". A correct “certain” response was awarded with two points, while a correct “guess” response was awarded with one point. An incorrect “guess” response resulted in no points being won or lost, but an incorrect “certain” response resulted in a loss of two points. Confidence was given with the same button press as the decision.Manipulations
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to different brain areas. V1, Pz, or sham TMS (continuous theta burst stimulation) was delivered on different days. Subjects completed trials both before and after stimulation. 1: pre_V1, 2: post_V1, 3: pre_Pz, 4: post_Pz, 5: pre_sham, 6: post_sham.Block size
140. Each subject came for 3 days and completed 5 blocks pre- and 5 blocks post-TMS.Feedback
No trial-by-trial feedback was provided; however, after each block, subjects were shown their accumulated score from the last block.

NaN fields
Subjects were given 1.8 seconds to respond. If subjects failed to respond within this time period, their response was recorded as NaN.
Subject population
Young adults (19-26 years old).Response device
Computer keyboard.Training
A separate day of training with the task.Experiment goal
Examine the effect of V1 TMS on performance and confidence. 

Main result
V1 TMS decreased both accuracy and confidence.
