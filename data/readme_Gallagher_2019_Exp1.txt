Stimulus: A motion adaptation protocol was used in which a period of adaptation to coherent motion was followed with motion direction test stimulus. Participants gave a binary forced-choice direction categorisation followed by a binary confidence response. 

Confidence scale: Participants made sequential decision-confidence responses. Both responses were binary forced choice (1=Left/Right motion, 2=High/Low confidence). Responses were coded as Leftward (Response = 0) or Rightward (Response = 1). Confidence was scored as Low confidence (Confidence = 0) or High confidence (Confidence = 1).

Manipulations: Baseline data collected with no adaptation period (condition = 0). Then, participants adapted to a single motion stimulus around fixation, with a coherent direction either to the left (condition = -1) or right (condition = 1). Ps then provided a categorisation of a subsequent test stimulus with varying motion coherence (0%-30%, randomised). Adaptation direction was randomly assigned and statistical comparisons were fully within subjects. 
No reaction time data were recorded for this experiment (judgments were untimed). I have not included these variables. 

Block size: The test stimuli consisted of 11 coherence values presented 10 times each, repeated for each of the adaptation conditions (Left Adapt and Right Adapt) totalling 220 stimulus observations in Experiment 1. An additional 10 observations for each stimulus were recorded at baseline, totalling 110 Baseline observations. 

Feedback: Participants received no trial-by-trial feedback.
Subject population: No demographic details were recorded.

Response device: Keyboard directional arrows (L/R response, Up/Down confidence).
Experimental setting: In lab, supervised by experimenter.
Special instructions: Judge the appearance of the stimulus, and report high or low confidence.
