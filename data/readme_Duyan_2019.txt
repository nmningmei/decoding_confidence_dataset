Stimulus: The numerical stimuli were arrays of grey dots on a black background, presented for 500ms. Overall, the numbers ranged between 4 and 29. The target numbers (i.e., 4, 7, 11, 16, 22 and 29) were presented on half of the trials (40 each). The rest of the numbers were presented on the rest of the trials as filler numerosities (12 each). Subjects then rated confidence on a 1-3 scale. They were then immediately asked whether they undershot or overshot the target (ErrorDirectionJudgment = "-1" [undershot] or "1" [overshot]). The "response" column indicates the participants numerical estimate. "Error" variable shows the numerical distance between the target and the response.

Confidence Scale: The scale was 1-3 with 1 = not confident, 2 = somewhat confident and, 3 = confident

Error Direction Judgment: -1 = undershot, 1 = overshot

Block size: Participants completed 2 blocks of 240 trials. Target numerosities were presented in a random order.

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: Participants completed 5 training trials, feedback was provided for these trials.
