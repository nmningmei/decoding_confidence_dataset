Stimulus Details:
Difficulty:
   Motion coherence
   Four coherence levels presented within each block (0.032, 0.064, 0.128, 0.256)
   The dot generation algorithm employed in this study was based on that of Shadlen and Newsome (2001) and programmed using PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007).
Stimulus: 1 is rightwards, 0 left
Response: 1 is rightwards, 0 left
Accuracy: 1 is correct

Confidence scale:
10-20-30-40-50
Post-Decision Wager (uni-directional)
On choosing a direction, participants were required to gamble 10 to 50 points on their answer using a drop-down menu. If the correct direction was chosen, a participant gained the chosen points, and if they chose the incorrect direction, the same number of points was deducted from their accumulated score. Participants were told at the beginning of the experiment that the aim was to earn as many points as possible by the end of the session. Upon making a number selection, a feedback stimulus appeared on the screen informing subjects whether they had answered correctly and the number of points won or lost.

Manipulations: No further manipulations

Block size: 48 trials, 10 Blocks

Feedback: Included

Training: 1 is practice, 0 is not

Additional Information

Subject population: 
Undergraduate psychology students (N = 28, 4 male, 24 female, mean age 19.6 years) completed an experimental session in exchange for course credit.

Response device: Mouse

Exclude subjects: The variable, exclude_subj, indicate subjects recommended to be excluded

Experiment setting: Laboratory. 
Participants' eye movements were tracked so they rested their head on chinrest.
The chin-rest was 80cm away from the monitor and 70cm from the eye-tracker. 
The task was performed on a 23 inches screen with the resolution of 1080p and 144Hz refresh rate. The stimuli were displayed on at 3 degree of visual angle. 

Experiment goal: Investigate mouse and eye movement during perceptual decisions

Main result: Mouse cursor deflection provides additional information on decision processes

Experiment dates: Jan-March 2017

Location of data collection: NUI Galway, Ireland
