Stimulus
The task was to draw straight trajectories using a joystick, and detect if there were deviations in these trajectories. Visual deviations of trajectories were introduced in 79% of trials. Participants had to detect and correct for the deviations. (Yes = 1; No = -1; if no response given = 0). 
The response was given using the joystick handle: by going left or right, they could select "Yes" or "No", and after that, press on a button to confirm.

Stimulus intensity
Stimulus intensity is the angle (in degrees) by which the visual trajectory is perturbed from midline.

Confidence scale
Confidence was given in a five-point scale (1 – not confident at all, 2 – a little unconfident, 3 – neither confident nor unconfident, 4 – a little confident, 5- very confident).Confidence was given using the joystick handle and always started in the middle point. By going left or right they could select the "1", "2",..."5" then press on a button to confirm.

Block size
Event-related design. 3 sessions of 80, 104 and 104 trials.

Feedback
No trial-by-trial feedback was provided.

Subject population
Adults (19-40 years old). Data from one participant was removed from analyses as she did not complete the visuomotor experiment, and structural MRI could not be obtained from two others. 

Response device
In-house built program and an MRI compatible joystick. Only trials for which there was a first order response were included (e.g. subjects reached the target and provided a first order answer), thus some subjects have few trials less than 288. One subject has 295 trials (e.g. 7 trials more) considering the session was interrupted due to a computer problem in the middle of the session. 
We added a few more trials to ensure we had the necessary trials for this subject. 

Training
30 trials of training with the task.

Experiment goal
We examined whether differences in brain structure predict individual variability in metacognitive sensitivity for visuomotor performance.

Main result
Larger gray matter volume in right anterior insula, right fusiform gyrus, and right prefrontal cortex predicted higher metacognitive sensitivity.
