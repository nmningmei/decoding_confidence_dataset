Stimulus: A dual-task paradigm with central and/or peripheral stimulus detection. Stimulus_1 corresponds to the central stimulus (an array of 5 rotated letters) and is coded ‘same’ if all the letters were identical or ‘different’ if a single letter was different. Stimulus_2 corresponds to the peripheral stimulus. In Experiment 2 the peripheral stimulus was a vertically bisected disc with one side red and one side green. If the red side appeared to the left this was coded ‘red-green’ and ‘green-red’ if the green side of the disc was on the left. Response_1 and Response_2 indicate the corresponding judgment for each stimulus type. Central and peripheral stimuli appeared on every trial (counterbalanced) but to avoid analysis errors I have coded the stimulus/response as ‘NaN’ if it was not task-relevant in the given block.

Confidence scale: Participants made a simultaneous decision and confidence rating. Confidence was rated on a 4-point scale from 1 to 4. Participants were instructed that a rating of 1 corresponded to a ‘complete guess’ and a rating of 4 corresponded to ‘absolutely certain’. No explicit verbal instructions were given for confidence ratings of 2 or 3 but participants were encouraged to use the full confidence scale.

Manipulations: In Experiment 2 we manipulated Attention and Report. Attention was manipulated such that in the full attention condition (Condition_Attention code: ‘full_attention’) participants focussed on just the central (Task code: ‘central_task’) or peripheral (Task code: ‘peripheral_task’) stimulus. In the diverted attention condition (Condition_Attention code: ‘diverted_attention’) participants focussed on both stimuli at once (Task code: ‘dual_tasks’). Participants were instructed about the attention condition at the beginning of each block. Report was manipulated in diverted attention blocks such that in the partial-report condition (Condition_Report code: ‘partial_report’) participants were required to focus on both stimuli but reported on only one of these stimuli on each trial (pseudo-randomly selected). Otherwise, in the whole-report condition (Condition_Report code: ‘whole_report’) participants responded to the central stimulus and then the peripheral stimulus. 

Block size: In Experiment 2 each block was 30 trials in length. Each participant completed 4 training blocks and 40 experimental blocks.

Feedback: Participants received no trial-by-trial feedback.

NaN fields: I have coded Stimulus/Response/Confidence/etc cells ‘NaN’ if the corresponding stimulus was not task-relevant in a given block. Unfortunately, no reaction time data was recorded for either experiment (judgments were untimed). For completion sake, I have included variables for each task (RT_decConf_1 and RT_decConf_2) but coded them NaN. In ‘partial_report’ blocks I have coded the unreported stimulus as NaN.

Subject population: Age range 18-38. Several participants completed both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. I have used the same coding for 'Subject_idx' as those in Experiment 1 (data_Matthews_2018_exp1.csv)

Response device: Mouse.

Experimental setting: In lab supervised by experimenter.

Special instructions: Subjects were encouraged to use the full confidence scale.
