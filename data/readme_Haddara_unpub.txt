In the ‘Stimulus’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates which stimulus class was the dominant one in the grid for that trial. For Task 1: 1 means that there were more X’s in the grid, 2 means there were more O’s in the grid. For Task 2: 1 means that there were more red circles in the grid, 2 means there were more blue circles in the grid. The dominant stimulus class was randomly determined on each trial, with the proportion of the dominant stimulus within the 7 x 7 grid fixed across trials at 31/49 for Task 1 and 27/49 for Task 2.ResponseIn the ‘Response’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates which stimulus class participants selected on each trial (X or O for Task 1, red or blue for Task 2).ConfidenceA confidence rating using a 4-point scale was used.FeedbackWhether or not trial-by-trial error feedback (“Correct”/“Wrong”) was provided was the main manipulation in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to a Feedback or No Feedback group and completed the two perceptual tasks (Task 1 and Task 2). In Task 2, neither group received feedback on their perceptual decisions in order to determine whether any putative improvements would generalize to a new task. In the ‘Feedback’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (0 or 1) indicates the trials for which feedback was given: 1 means feedback was provided and 0 means no feedback was provided.Number of trials480 total trials. Task 1 was 330 trials and Task 2 was 150 trials. All trials were completed in a single session.Subject populationAdults age 18-40 using MTurk in the United States.Response deviceComputer keyboard.Main goalExamine the effects of trial-by-trial feedback on performance and confidence.Main result Trial-by-trial feedback reduced response bias, enhanced confidence calibration and generated faster reaction times for perceptual decisions.Experiment datesData were collected in October and November, 2019.Language of data collectionEnglish.Location of data collectionOnline via MTurk
