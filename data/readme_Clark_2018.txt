Stimulus: the stimulus is a single, unidirectional, whole-body, passive rotation about an Earth-vertical axis in the dark (vestibular perceptual thresholds). The subject is seated upright, so the rotation is in their 'yaw' axis. The rotation profile is a single-cycle sinusoid in angular acceleration that is 1 second in duration (frequency of 1 Hz). The stimulus can be either to the left or right (coded by -1 or 1, respectively). 
-1 = rotations to the negative direction (yaw left)
1 = rotations to the positive direction (yaw right)

Confidence scale: uncertain (coded as 1) vs. not uncertain (i.e., certain, coded as 2). 

Manipulations: There were no manipulations. There were different 'Tasks' which defined the ordering of reporting perceived direction of motion (decision) and confidence (uncertain vs. certain). 

Block size: 75 trials. In total, each subject completed 56 blocks for ~4,200 trials per subject. There were a few blocks in which one fewer trial was performed accidentally. To denote this 'Trial_in_block' is provided that normally runs from 1-75, but sometimes runs from 1-74. On each block, one of three different 'Tasks' was performed, which defined the ordering of reporting perceived direction of motion (decision) and confidence (uncertain vs. certain): 1) on 38 blocks the '2-stage binary/uncertainty' task was performed (~2,850 trials), 2) on 9 blocks the '2-stage trinary/binary' was performed (675 trials), and 3) on 9 blocks the '1-stage binary/uncertainty' was performed (675 trials).

Feedback: NO feedback was included. 

Stimulus Peak Velocity: The magnitude of the rotation stimulus was varied using an adaptive staircase. The magnitude was defined by the peak angular velocity that was reached during the rotation. (The profile all of rotations was a single-cycle sinusoid in angular acceleration.) 

NaN fields: There are NaN fields only if the data failed to properly record. 

Subject population: Four of the paper's authors (Clark, Yi, Galvan-Garza, and Bermudez-Rey) formed the subject pool. The stimuli direction was randomized by a computer so neither subject nor operator had 'inside information' regrading motion stimuli. All subjects reported no history of vestibular dysfunction. 

Response device: Subjects used a custom iPad application to record their responses. In the '2-stage binary/uncertainty' task, subjects were instructed 'You will use the iPad to record your responses in two phases. First, if you feel that you have rotated to your right, please press the right side of the screen with your right thumb. If you feel that you have rotated to your left, press the left side of the screen with your left thumb.' The iPad confirmed the response using a computer-generated voice ('left' or 'right'). This was followed by an indication of whether they were uncertain or not uncertain. Specifically the subjects were instructed, 'After you have made this first selection, you will indicate your confidence. If you are uncertain, press both the left and right sides of the screen at the same time. Otherwise tap the same side of the screen again to confirm your selection.' The iPad confirmed this second entry using a computer generated voice ('guess' or 'not a guess'). Thus, in the '2-stage binary/uncertainty' task, subjects first recorded their decision and then reported their confidence. 
In the '2-stage trinary/binary' task, subject first provided a trinary response (left, right, or uncertainty) by pressing the left side of the screen, right side of the screen, or both sides of the screen at the same time (uncertain).  Computer-generated voice feedback was provided ('left' or 'right' or 'guess'). This was followed by a forced binary response if they first reported being uncertain (left or right reported by tapping that side of the screen). Again voice feedback was provided ('left' or 'right'). 
In the '1-stage binary/uncertainty' task, each subject provided their indication by tapping one of four virtual 'buttons' in the dark. To indicate perceived motion to the right (left) and that they were uncertain, the subject was instructed to press the lower right (left) button. The computer-generated voice confirmed the entry by saying 'right, guess' (or 'left, guess'). To indicate perceived motion to the right (left) and that they were not uncertain, the subject was instructed to push the upper right (left) button. The computer-generated voice confirmed this entry by saying 'right, not a guess' (or 'left, not a guess'). 
For each Task, the data was coded as a direction decision (-1 = left, 1 = right) and a confidence report (1 = uncertain, 2 = certain). 

Experiment setting: Laboratory. On a human-rated rotational motion device in the dark.

Training: Subjects were introduced to the types of motions they would experience. Then, first had an opportunity to practice reporting the perceived direction (with some suprathreshold motions to ensure the subject understood the directions correctly). Then subjects were given an opportunity to practice reporting confidence. Training continued until the subject reported they were ready to proceed with testing. This was typically 15-30 training trials. Feedback was not provided on training other than confirmation they were performing the task appropriately. At least a few practice trials were provided at the beginning of each Block.  

Experiment goal: To assess how subjects made binary (left vs. right) decisions when they reported being uncertain. 

Main result: Even when uncertain, subjects fully utilize complete information to make the binary decision (left vs. right). 

Special instructions: Subjects were told that during each trial 'there will always be a rotation, even if it is very small. Even if you are not sure of the direction you must choose and press only one button; just make your best guess.' In addition, they were told: 'on average half the rotations are to the left and half are right. The direction is selected randomly by a computer. This means that previous trials directions have no impact on the next rotation direction. While very unlikely, you could even experience 10 or more rotations in a row in the same direction.'
Subjects were asked if they had any questions about the task, their reporting, or confidence prior to starting testing. If any questions were ask, the experiment operator answered them appropriately. 
Subjects were not instructed about how quickly to respond. 
All quotations are instructions that were verbatim read to the subject just prior to the start of the experiment.
