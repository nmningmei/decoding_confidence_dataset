This experiment tries to establish a link between the metacognitive capacity and attachment types of 204 mothers.

******************************************************************
Task: Visual Metacognition (see Fleming et al., 2010). No manipulation

Confidence Scale: Continuous, 1 (sure I made an error) and 6 (sure I answered correctly)

Block Size:  200 trials / 5 Blocks 

Feedback: None

Subject population: 204 woman (18-35)

Training: 50 trials. Not reported here 

Special Instructions: Respond in less than 2000 ms. Due to technical problems, RTs> = 2000 ms were not registered. Consequently, they were coded as NaN.

******************************************************************
Data:

Stimulus: Stimulus Identity (1 = First Scene, 2 =  Second Scene)
Response: Subject's response (1 = First Scene, 2 = Second Scene)
Confidence: Subject's confidence rating (between 1 and 6)
RT_dec: The decision reaction time (RT in seconds)
RT_conf: The confidence reaction time (RT in seconds)
Contrast: The contrast varied during the experiment.
