Stimulus: A sinusoidal grating oriented either horizontally or vertically, followed by a mask after varying stimulus-onset-asynchronies. 1 means vertical and 2 means horizonal.

Confidence scale: Continuous confidence scale ranging from -1 to 1. The scale ends were labelled as "unsure" and "sure".

Manipulations: Orientation of the grating: horizontal vs. vertical; Stimulus-onset-asynchrony between target stimulus and mask: 8.3, 16.7, 33.3, 66.7, or 133 ms

Block size: 1 training block and 9 experimental blocks, 60 trials each

Feedback: After incorrect responses only. 

Subject population: age 18-24, 12 males, 27 females

Response device: Orientation judgment: Keyboard; Confidence: Joystick

Experiment setting: Lab

Training: 1 Block. 1 = training, 0 = main experiment

Experiment goal: test if the weighted evidence and visibility model provides a better account of confidence in visual decisions than previously proposed SDT models of confidence. 

Main result: the weighted evidence and visibility model indeed provides a better account of confidence in visual decisions than previously proposed SDT models of confidence. 

Special instructions: report orientation and your degree of confidence as accurately as possible
