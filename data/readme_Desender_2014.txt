Stimulus:
Priming arrows that pointed either leftwards (L) or rightwards (R). 
These were preceeded by masked priming arrows that either pointed in the same direction (Congr) or the other direction (Incongr), as indicated by the column 'Congruency'.

Confidence scale:
1 = I think there was a conflict
2 = I don't know! (but I guess there was a conflict)
3 = I don't know! (but I guess there was no conflict)
4 = I think there was no conflict

Manipulations
Trials were either congruent or incongruent, as explained in the stimulus section. 

Block size:
Training 1: 8 trials
Training 2: 40 trials
Main: 8 blocks of 60 trials

Feedback:
Feedback was only presented during Training 1

Subject population:
University students (mean age = 19.24 years, SD = 1.5, range = 17-24)

Response device:
azerty keyboard

Experiment setting:
Individual booth

Training:
See above

Experiment goal:
Show that i) stimulus (in)congruency affects subjective difficulty ratings, even though the primes were presented subliminally, and ii) that cognitive control depends on subjective difficulty rather than on stimulus (in)congruency

Main result:
see paper

Special instructions:
'Try to be as fast and accurate as possible' and 'try to use the whole scale'

November 2012
