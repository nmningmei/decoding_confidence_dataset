data is from the memory task of the above papaer including both patient and control group.

Stimulus:
The task was a word recognition memory test consisting of a learning and a recognition phase. During the learning phase, 100 words were presented on the screen, one at a time. The list of 100 words were randomly chosen for each participant from a pool of 200 words. Each word was displayed at the center of the screen for 1500 msec, with an ISI of 1000 msec between subsequent words. In the recognition phase, all 200 words were presented one at a time. The participant decided if the word was new or had previously been presented in the learning phase. All words were in Farsi language.
if stimulus = 0: the word is old
if stimulus = 1: the word is new

Response:
if Response = 0: participant decided that the word is old
if Response = 1: participant decided that the word is new

Confidence scale:
confidence rating was on a 6-point scale using numbers 1 (very unsure) to 6(very sure).

Manipulations: 
None

Block size:
All trials were in one block

Feedback:
None

Subject population:
All subjects were male.
'Patient' group were individuals with opiate dependence under methadone maintenance treatment
'Control' group were healthy individuals with no addiction history

Response device: 
Keyboard

Experiment goal:
To compare metacognitive ability in substance dependent individuals with healthy population in the two tasks involving memory or perception. 

Main finding:
Metacognition was significantly impaired in substance dependent individuals specifically in one task (perceptual) but not in the other.
