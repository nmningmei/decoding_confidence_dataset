Stimulus:
A random dot kinematogram (RDK). On each trial, motion trajectories for 200 dots are drawn from a circular gaussian with mean -45 or +45 degrees (i.e. up-left or up-right diagonal).
The dispersion parameter of the generative dot distribution determines the task difficulty.
In the data file, this parameter is called NoiseLevel.
The participant's task is to report whether the mean direction is left or right and give their confidence.

Stimulus coding:
0 = left
1 = right

Confidence scale:
Confidence rating from 50 to 100

Manipulations:
This was a 2 x 3 within-subjects design.
- Factor 1: Difficulty (easy/hard). 
            Easy trials had motion trajectories drawn from a relatively narrow generative distribution.
            Hard trials had motion trajectories drawn from a relatively broad generative distribution.
            The generative distribution variances were titrated for each subject using staircase procedures.
            They were titrated such that performance was ~80% on easy trials and ~60% on hard trials.

- Factor 2: Expected difficulty (low, control high). 
            This was manipulated block-wise.
            In 'Low' blocks, 75% of trials were easy and 25% of trials were hard.
            In 'Control' blocks, 50% of trials were easy and 50% of trials were hard.
            In 'High' blocks, 25% of trials were easy and 75% of trials were hard.
            Participants were not told whether easy or hard trials would be more likely (they had to learn this implicitly).

Condition coding:
 - 1: Easy stimulus, expect easy
 - 2: Easy stimulus, control
 - 3: Easy stimulus, expect hard
 - 4: Hard stimulus, expect easy
 - 5: Hard stimulus, control
 - 6: Hard stimulus, expect hard

Block Size:
56 trials per block

Feedback:
None

Subject population:
24 healthy subjects (age = 20.8 +/ 3.2, 21 female)

Response device:
Keyboard

Experiment setting:
Lab

Training:
Approximately 10 minutes

Experiment goal:
Test whether decision confidence is biased by priors on confidence (self-efficacy)

Main result:
Confidence is more sensitive to experienced difficulty (positive evidence) under high self-efficacy

Special instructions:
Subjects were told that in each block, either an easy or hard stimulus would be more likely. However, the expectation had to be learnt implicitly over the course of the block.
