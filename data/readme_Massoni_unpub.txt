Citation: Unpublished data, a preprint will be available in the near future.

Stimulus: Participants were briefly presented with two circles, each containing a number of white dots. Calibration of the difficulty (by the dots difference) with a preliminary 2-up 1-down staircase targeting 71% of accuracy. 

Response: Participants were asked to select the circle that contained the more dots (left or right circle).

Block: 4 blocks of 50 trials.

Confidence scale: The rating scale was from 0% to 100% with steps of 10%. Confidence accuracy is incentivized with an auction mechanism called probability matching (see Massoni, Gajdos & Vergnaud, 2014, Frontiers in Psychology, for details), such that participants have to report the most precisely and truthfully confidence as the probability of their choice being correct to maximize their earnings. There was no time limit for providing confidence ratings.

Difficulty: change the number of dots difference (within-subject) with difficulty = 1 if two times the dots difference obtained by the staircase and difficulty = 2 with half the dots difference (rounded) obtained by the staircase.

Feedback: No feedback on accuracy after each trial in Study 1 (subjects 1 to 23), feedback in Study 2 (subjects 24 to 50).

Manipulation: Study 1 has no feedback while Study 2 has feedback; two levels of difficulty. Part of a larger experiment with one between-subject treatment (independent sessions) still not available.
