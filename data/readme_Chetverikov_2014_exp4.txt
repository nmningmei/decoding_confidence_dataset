Stimulus: On each trial, observers saw a degraded image that they had to categorize into one of three categories: Human, Animal, or Object. Then, they indicated their confidence (Confidence) and how much did they like the image (Liking). The second rating appeared only after the first one was given. Stimulus difficulty is computed for each subject and stimulus as a share of correct responses to this stimulus by other subjects. 

Confidence scale: Confidence was rated on a 100-point scale. No explicit verbal instructions were given about the interpretation of the scale. 

Manipulations: The order of ratings (Confidence and Liking) was counterbalanced between observers. In addition, half of the images presented for each subject were pleasant while the other half were unpleasant.

Main result: both confidence and liking ratings reflect response accuracy regardless of image pleasantness. With higher confidence, the difference in liking between correct and incorrect responses (conditioned on confidence level) becomes larger.

Block size: Each participant did three training images and 117 trials in the main part without breaks. 

Feedback: no feedback was provided.

Subject population: Undergraduate students (age is included in the data). 

Response device: Keyboard for categorization, mouse for ratings.

Experimental setting: At the lab.

Experiment dates: 2014.
