Stimulus: A sinusoidal grating oriented either horizontally or vertically, followed by a mask after varying stimulus-onset-asynchronies. 1 means vertical and 2 means horizontal.

Confidence scale: Continuous confidence scale ranging from -1 to 1. The scale ends were labelled as "unsure" and "sure".

Manipulations: Orientation of the grating: horizontal vs. vertical; Stimulus-onset-asynchrony between target stimulus and mask: 8.3, 16.7, 33.3, 66.7, or 133 ms

Block size: 1 training Block and 9 experimental blocks, 60 trials each

Feedback: After incorrect responses only. 

Subject population: age 18-40, 3 males, 17 females

Response device: Joystick. Participants reported the orientation of the stimulus and their degree of confidence at the same time: They indicated the orientation of the target stimulus by either moving the joystick back or forward, and at the same time, they reported their degree of confidence by moving the joystick to the left or to the right. 

Experiment setting: Lab

Training: 1. Block. 1 = training, 0 = main experiment

Experiment goal: test if the weighted evidence and visibility model provides a better account of confidence in visual decisions than previously proposed SDT models of confidence. 

Main result: the weighted evidence and visibility model indeed provides a better account of confidence in visual decisions than previously proposed SDT models of confidence. 

Special instructions: report orientation and your degree of confidence as accurately as possible
