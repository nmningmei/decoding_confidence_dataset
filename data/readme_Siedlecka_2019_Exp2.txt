Stimulus
The stimuli were 240 Polish six-to-eight letter words (maximum three syllables) chosen from a subtitle-based frequency list (Mandera, Keuleers, Wodniecka, & Brysbaert, 2015). Participants’ task was to decide if the presented word had appeared on the list (McCurdy et al., 2013), so available responses were 'yes' or 'no'.  Each of the six lists contained 20 words, each starting with a different letter.
For more details and a graphical representation of the trial, please see the article's methods section.

Confidence scale
The confidence scale was associated with either the question “How confident are you that you will make the right decision?”, or “How confident are you that you made the right decision?” The alternatives were “I am guessing”, “I am not confident”, “I am quite confident”, and “I am very confident” (Dienes & Perner, 2004).

Manipulations
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions that differed with respect to the memory task response and confidence rating order. Either the response to the target words preceded the confidence rating (R-CR, response-confidence rating), or the confidence rating preceded the word-related response (CR-R, confidence rating-response). Contrary to the previous experiment, here the target word was always presented before word-related response and confidence rating were required. 

Procedure
There were 6 experimental blocks, each started with a list of words presented at the center of the screen for 20 s and was followed by a distracting task consisting of 6 algebra equations, to which participants responded by typing the outcome number. Twenty experimental trials followed, each starting with a fixation point presented in the center of the screen for 500 ms and then target word presented for 500 ms. Then participants either performed the decision task (whether presented word had previously appeared on the list - yes or no) or rated their confidence.

Block size
There were six blocks - each composed of 20 trials (summing up to 120 trials).

Feedback
No feedback was provided.

NaN fields
Predominantly NaNs are in trials when distractors were presented (so no response or confidence rating was recorded).
NaNs are also present if participants failed to react in given time for either response of confidence rating.

Subject population
Students of Jagiellonian University (Cracow, Poland) recruited through a dedicated system.
Fifty-five volunteers (eight males) aged 19 to 30 (M 􏰀 20.31, SD 􏰀 1.64).

Response device
Computer keyboard.

Experiment goal
To investigate the influence of decision and response on metacognitive accuracy in a memory task.


Main result
Metacognitive accuracy is higher when metacognitive judgment follows response.

Fields in the .csv file: 

'Subj_idx'  	: subject identification number (1 to 55).
'Stimulus'  	: 1 - old word, 2 - new word.
'Response'  	: 1 - presented word is the old word, 2 - presented word is the new word
'Confidence'	: 1 - I am guessing, 2 - I am not confident, 3 - I am quite confident, 4 - I am very confident. 
'RT_dec'	: reaction time of the response, NaN where no reaction was made.
'RT_conf' 	: reaction time for the confidence decision.
'Accuracy'	: 0 - an error was made; 1 - correct response.
'Condition'	: 0 - decision then scale, 1 - scale then decision.
'Gender'	: participants gender as declared by themselves (0 - woman, 1 - man).
'Age'		: age of the participants in years.
'Block_type'	: 0 - training, from 1 to 6 - experimental blocks (the number indicates a list from which the words were chosen, there were six lists of words, for each participant lists were presented in a different order), 9 - distracting task.
