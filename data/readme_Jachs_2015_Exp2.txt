Category: Visual perception

Stimulus: 

On each trial, participants were required to discriminate the orientation of a brief, masked Gabor, presented at the threshold of visual awareness. Left tilted stimuli are coded as 1 and right tilted as 2. Left tilted responses are coded as 1 and right tilted responses as 2. In addition, prior to the discrimination response, participants were asked to report on the state of visual awareness of the stimulus. Following the discrimination response, they also rated the confidence in the correctness of the discrimination response.


Confidence scale: 

Both awareness and confidence reports were collected on each trial.

Regarding the awareness response, participants rated their visual experience with the following options: 'no experience of the stimulus' (coded as 1), 'brief glimpse but no experience of the orientation' (coded as 2) and 'almost clear experience or clear experience' (coded as 3).

Regarding the confidence response, Experiment 2 employed a 1-3 scale to rate the level of response confidence with higher levels coded with higher numbers.  


Manipulations: None

Feedback: No

NaN fields: There were no response deadlines and all answers were recorded. There should be no NaNs. 

Block size:  There were 10 blocks of 50 trials each.

Trial count: Please note this starts with 0, so 0 is trial 1.

Subject population: Participants were healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 29 years. Standard exclusion criteria were applied in Experiment 2 as indicated in the paper.

Response device: Keyboard.

Experiment setting: Laboratory.

Training: There was a short practice with visible stimuli to familiarise participants with the discrimination task. A calibration phase of the luminance of the Gabor followed. Then, participants performed 30 training trials in the actual experimental task.

Experiment goal: To assess the extent to which type-1 (perceptual) and type-2 (metacognitive) sensitivity are dependent on the state of visual awareness.

Main result: The level of type-1 perceptual sensitivity was strongly related to the state of visual awareness, but this was not the case for type-2 metacognitive sensitivity.

Special instructions: Participants were instructed that confidence ratings should be conceived in a relative fashion and hence they were asked to use all the confidence ratings independently of the awareness rating so that participants would not simply choose low confidence every time they were unaware and vice-versa on aware trials. They were also instructed to respond as precisely as possible in all the three responses. There was no response deadline and speed was not emphasised.

Experiment dates: Data was collected in December 2013.
