Stimulus
Indicates old/new status (1 = Old, 0 = New). 'Old' means that the item was previously seen on the study list; 'new' means that it was not previously seen on the study list.

Response
Indicates binary old/new response, which was extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Studied", 0 = "Not Studied".

Confidence scale
Indicates low, medium, or high confidence, extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Maybe", 2 = "Probably", 3 = "Definitely". The 1-6 response scale used by participants was as follows: 1 = Definitely Not Studied, 2 = Probably Not Studied, 3 = Maybe Not Studied, 4 = Maybe Studied, 5 = Probably Studied, 6 = Definitely Studied. The Raw_Response column contains the responses in this format.

Manipulations
A brief training sequence was manipulated between subjects. In one condition, participants passively viewed a short series of sample stimuli (paintings) before beginning the main study-test cycles. In the other condition, participants studied and were tested on recognition of a brief series of paintings before beginning the main study-test cycles. This manipulation was secondary to the hypotheses of main interest and had no effect on the measures of interest. Training data are not included in the file.

Block size
There were two study-test cycles, each with 48 study items and 96 test items, separated by 300 trials of a Go-No Go task.

Feedback

Experiment goal
Test whether recognition response bias on Test 1 would predict that on Test 2, whether average response bias across the two tests would predict Go-No Go task performance, and whether average response bias across the two tests would predict response bias in Experiment 2 from the same paper (Kantner & Lindsay, 2014), for those participants completing both experiments.

Main result
There were significant positive correlations of recogntion response bias across the two tests and between this experiment and Experiment 2 (among participants completing both experiments). Average response bias weakly predicted Go-No Go task accuracy.
