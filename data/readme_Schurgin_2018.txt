Stimulus
Participants were shown colors and asked to remember them. They were then shown either an old or new color after a brief delay and asked to indicate if it was old or new (relative to the color that had just appeared in that location). The colors were drawn from a circular section of CIELab color space and converted to RGB for display purposes. The Stimulus column indicates whether the same color was shown at test as was studied in that location (1; old) or a different color, 180 deg away in test space (2; new). 

Confidence scale
6-point scale: "very unsure" to "very sure". 

Manipulations
While one color was always probed, a varying number were shown and all of these items needed to be held in working memory, as participants did not know which would be probed. In this experiment, there was set size 1 (only the target shown), set size 3 (two distractors), and set size 6 (five distractors).

Additional Fields:
The Setsize column indicates how many colors participants needed to hold in mind on that trial. The TargetColor, TestColor, and DistractorXColor fields indicate the colors shown, in R;G;B format. 

Block size
Participants completed 5 blocks of 60 trials, all in one session, with only small pauses between blocks. Trials of all set sizes were interleaved within these blocks.

Feedback
No feedback was provided.

NaN fields
The only NaN fields are in the distractor columns, for trials where fewer than 5 additional colors were presented (e.g. Set Size 1 and 3).

Subject population
Young adults (19-35 years old).

Response device
Computer keyboard.

Training
Participants completed 9 practice trials (3 per set size) before beginning the main task. 

Experiment goal
Examine ROCs for visual working memory as a function of set size, to distinguish threshold vs. signal detection models of performance.

Main result
ROCs are reliably curvilinear and consistent with a nearly-equal variance signal detection model.
