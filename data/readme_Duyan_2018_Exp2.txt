Stimulus: Stimuli were sequentially presented  beep sounds (444 Hz, 60ms) with random interstimulus intervals varying between 300 and 600 ms (uniformly distributed). Participants were asked to stop the sequence by pressing the space key when they thought the beep count reached the target number (Stimulus = "7" or "11"). Subjects then rated confidence on a 1-3 scale. They were then immediately asked whether they undershot or overshot the target (ErrorDirectionJudgment = "-1" [undershot] or "1" [overshot]). The "response" column indicates the number of beeps that was presented before the participant stopped the sequence. "Error" variable shows the numerical distance between the target and the response.

Confidence Scale: The scale was 1-3 with 1 = Not confident, 2 = Somewhat Confident and, 3 = Confident

Error Direction Judgment: -1 = undershot, 1 = overshot

Block size: Participants completed 4 blocks of 12 minutes. The target was the same (7 or 11) within blocks, and alternated between blocks ([7 11 7 11] or [11 7 11 7]).

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: Participants completed 5 training trials, feedback was provided for these trials.
