Stimulus
Pairs of images extracted from a video narrative. 

Confidence scale
4-point scale:  "Very Low", "Low", "High", "Very High"

Manipulations
Participants performed either N task (judge the narrated order of a pair of images, could be treated as a memory task) or C task (judge the chronological order of a pair of images, more like a inference task). Conditions including whether the task-irrelevant temporal order is congruent with the task-relevant order: Congruent or Incongruent. The task-relevant temporal distance: C task, 2 levels; N task, 7 levels.

Block size
70.
