Relating inter-individual differences in metacognitive performance on different perceptual tasks. Consciousness and cognition, 20(4), 1787-1792.* The dataset includes Experiment1 and Experiment2 in the paper. The two experiments are indicated as Task1 and Task2 in the dataset, respectively.Stimulus:* On each trial, the visual stimuli were presented twice with each presentation lasting 200 ms and the inter-stimulus interval lasting 500 ms. In one of the two presentation intervals, the six gratings were exactly the same, but in the other interval, one of the six gratings differed from the rest by a higher contrast (task one) or slightly different orientation (task two). * Stimulus=1 indicates that the pop out grating is in the first interval; Stimulus=2 indicates that the pop out grating is in the second interval. Confidence scale: * confidence rating between 1 (low confidence) and 6 (high confidence)Manipulations: * NoneBlock size: * 90 trials per block * 6 blocksFeedback: * NoneSubject population: * 10 females, 8 males* aged 19–33Response device: * Keyboard for perceptual answer* Mouse for confidence ratingExperiment setting: * LabTraining: * NoneExperiment goal: * To test whether the ability to introspect about different perceptual decisions might be mediated by a common cognitive process, we examined whether inter-individual differences in metacognitive ability were correlated across two different perceptual tasks where individuals made judgments about different and unrelated visual stimulus properties.Main result: * We found that inter-individual differences were strongly correlated between the two tasks for metacognitive ability but not objective performance. Such stability of an individual’s metacognitive ability across different perceptual tasks indicates a general mechanism supporting metacognition independent of the specific task.Special instructions: * subjects were encouraged to use the whole confidence scale* subjects were asked to make unspeeded answersExperiment dates:* May and June 2010Experiment Location:* UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, 17 Queen Square, London WC1N 3AR, UK Language in which the experiment was conducted:* English
