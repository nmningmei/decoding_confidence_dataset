Stimulus:
Stimuli were 300 two-character Chinese words. The word frequency varied between 0.24 and 46.29 per million words. The 300 words were randomly divided into two sets (each containing 150 words). One set of words was presented during the encoding phase, and the other set was used as new words during the recognition test.

In each trial of the recognition test, there were two words presented on the left and right of the screen. One of these words had been presented in the encoding phase (¡°old¡±), while the other word had not been presented previously (¡°new¡±). In the data file, Stimulus = 1 if old word was presented on the left, and Stimulus = 2 if old word was presented on the right. Participants had to press a key to indicate which word was old. In the data file, Response = 1 if they chose the left word, and Response = 2 if they chose the right word.

Experimental procedure:
This experiment was a memory task which consisted of two phases, encoding and recognition, with 24 h between the two. On the first day, participants sequentially viewed 150 words that were presented in the center of a screen. Immediately following the presentation of each word, participants gave a judgment of learning (JOL) in which they predicted the probability that they would correctly choose that word during the recognition test (the JOL data are currently not included in this data file). On the second day, participants performed a recognition test and gave a confidence rating for each trial.

Confidence scale:
6-point scale from 1 (very low confidence) to 6 (very high confidence). The point 1 indicates that participants were very unsure about whether their answer was correct. The point 6 indicates that participants were very sure that their answer was correct.

Manipulations:
There were no manipulations.

Block size:
There was only one block with 150 trials.

Feedback:
No trial-by-trial feedback was provided.
