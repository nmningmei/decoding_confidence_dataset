Stimulus
Indicates old/new status (1 = Old, 0 = New). 'Old' means that the item was previously seen on the study list; 'new' means that it was not previously seen on the study list.

Response
Indicates binary old/new response, which was extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Studied", 0 = "Not Studied".

Confidence scale
Indicates low, medium, or high confidence, extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Maybe", 2 = "Probably", 3 = "Definitely". The 1-6 response scale used by participants was as follows: 1 = Definitely Not Studied, 2 = Probably Not Studied, 3 = Maybe Not Studied, 4 = Maybe Studied, 5 = Probably Studied, 6 = Definitely Studied. The Raw_Response column contains the responses in this format.

Manipulations
The nature of old items and the presence of feedback were manipulated between subjects. The stimuli were words. In one condition ("big"), all old items referred to objects larger than a breadbox and all new items referred to objects smaller than a breadbox. In a second condition ("small"), old items were all smaller than a breadbox and new items were larger. In a third condition ("mixed"), the study status of the item was not confounded with the size of the referent object; that is, both old and new items could be both larger or smaller than a breadbox. In all three of these conditions, some participants received trial-by-trial corrective feedback and some did not. The Condition column indicates both of these conditions for each participant; for example, "big, no feedback" means that old items were larger than a breadbox, and feedback was not received.

Block size
There was one study-test cycle containing 75 study items and 150 test items.

Feedback
Feedback was provided for a random (roughly) half of participants. See "Manipulations" above.

Subject population
Undergraduate students.

Response device
Keyboard.

Training
None.

Experiment goal
Determine whether feedback could help participants increase their recognition sensitivity when feedback could versus could not help participants learn a category rule separating old and new items. 

Main result
Feedback did not significantly increase recognition sensitivity whether or not old/new status was confounded with object size.
