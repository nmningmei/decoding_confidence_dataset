Description: 
This experiment includes 4 tasks (episodic memory, semantic memory, visual perception, executive functions). The tasks were presented in a random order for each subject.

Stimulus: 
All tasks are 2AFC tasks. 
Episodic memory task (EM): Participants had to learn paired-words in a first phase. Then, they had to decide which one of the two target words was associated with the cue presented in the first phase.  
Visual perception task (VP): Participants were presented two circles containing dots and had to select the stimulus with more dots. 
Semantic memory task (SM): Participants performed decisions for French general knowledge questions.
Executive function task (EF): Participants were presented a letter-number sequence (e.g., 7A5N2) and had to select the responses corresponding to the sum of all numbers and letters (14AN).  

Confidence scale: 
We used a percentage of confidence 11-point rating scale (from 0% of confidence to 100% of confidence). 

Block size: 
Participants completed 40 trials per task and task order was randomly assigned for each participant. 

Feedback: 
No feedback was provided.

Subject population:
Participants were 181 young adults (Mage = 20.01, SDage = 3.13; 84% of women) recruited through an advertisement at the Grenoble-Alpes University.  

Response device: 
Keyboard ("s" for left responses and "l" for right responses).

Main results: 
Cross-task correlations for metacognitive bias and metacognitive efficiency (using a hierarchical Bayesian estimation of meta-d'/d' ratio).

Experiment dates: 
Data were collected between October – December 2017
