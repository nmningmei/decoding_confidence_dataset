The nature of the perceptual representation for decision making. bioRxiv preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/537068  Data are from the first experiment.  Stimulus7x7 grid stimuli with four different colored dots (red, green, blue, and white) presented at each coordinate in random order. One color was presented more frequently (n = 16) than the other colors (n = 11 respectively) in each trial. In the dataset, colors are indicated by numbers (1-Red, 2-Green, 3-Blue, and 4-White).Confidence scaleVersion 1: Discrete 1-4, 1 as lowest and 4 as highestVersion 2: Continuous 0-100% scaleManipulationsThe experiment consisted of three conditions. In the first condition, participants were able to choose any of the four colors as an answer. In the second condition, only two colors were allowed (one of them was always the correct one). In the third condition, participants were cued in advance which two colors will be given as options before seeing a stimulus. The data shows the wrong options that were presented for the second and the third condition in the column ‘Wrong_option’. The same column for the first condition is entered with ‘NaN’.Block size18 blocks (35 trials per block, 6 blocks per each condition). FeedbackNo feedback provided in the main experiment.Subject population32 subjects. Age mean = 18-29.Response devicesIn the first version, participants responded confidence level with the keyboard, using keys ‘m’ (for 1), ‘,’ (for 2), ‘.’ (for 3), and ‘/’ (for 4). In the second version, participants indicated the confidence level using the mouse. Decision responses were always collected using the keyboard. Keys for decision responses were ‘z’ (red), ‘x’ (green), ‘c’ (blue), and ‘v’ (white). Experiment settingIn lab.TrainingParticipants completed five blocks of training session. The first block has 10 trials from the first condition. The stimulus presentation time was longer (1 sec) than the main experiment (500ms) and feedback was given at the end of each trial. Beginning from the second block, the stimulus duration was reduced to 500ms. Second through fourth block has 15 trials from the three condition each. Feedback was still given for each trial. The last block has 15 trials from the first condition. In this last block, feedbacks were not given.Special instructionsIn the experiment with continuous scale for confidence evaluation, participants were instructed to rate below than 25% only if they actively believe that their decision answer was wrong.Link to materialhttps://github.com/wiseriver531/Discrete-representationExperiment datesMarch 15-April 13, 2017Location of data collection: Rahnev Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA
