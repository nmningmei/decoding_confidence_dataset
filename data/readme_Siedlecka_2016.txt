Siedlecka, M., Paulewicz, B., & Wierzchoń, M. (2016). But I was so sure! Metacognitive judgments are less accurate given prospectively than retrospectively. Frontiers in Psychology, 7, 218.

Stimulus
For the purpose of the study, 60 three-syllable Polish nouns containing 7–10 letters were chosen from a frequency list (Mandera et al., 2015). The words were paired so that 19 pairs of them differed by just 1 letter (in English this could be: SENATOR-TOASTER) and 11 pairs, which differed by 2 letters (e.g., RESTAURANT-TRANSLATOR), which could be either exchanged or added. The anagrams were made by randomly mixing the letters of one word in a pair.
Stimulus column is coded 0 - when the target word was not the solution of the anagram and 1 - if it was the solution.

Confidence scale
Participants were asked to rate the confidence of their future or past decision (“How confident are you that you will make the right decision?” or “How confident are you that you made the right decision?”). The options were: “I am guessing,” “I am not confident,” “I am quite confident,” and “I am very confident.”

Manipulations
We manipulated the order of target word presentation, response and confidence rating. There were three groups: (1) participants prospectively rated the confidence of their decision before even seeing a target (MtD),(2) participants firstly decided if a target word presented on a screen was the anagram solution and then judged their confidence (target-decision- metacognitive judgment, tDM), (3) they prospectively rated the confidence of their decision after seeing a target (tMD).

Block size
There were two blocks with 15 anagrams in each.

Feedback
Participants received no feedback.

NaN fields
NaN's in Response and RT_response columns are due to participants not making the reaction in time provided (3000ms).

Subject population
Ninety-seven volunteers, 65 women, aged 18–30 (M = 21.73, SD = 2.1).

Response device
Computer keyboard.

Experiment goal
Experiment was aiming to investigate the relation between performance in an anagram task and the accuracy of prospective and retrospective confidence judgments.

Main result
The results showed that although response accuracy always correlated with confidence, this relationship was weaker when metacognitive judgements were given before the anagram response.

Experiment dates
Data were collected in 2015.

Location of data collection
Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University (Cracow, Poland).

Fields in the .csv file: 


'Subj_idx'  	: subject identification number (1 to 97).
'Stimulus'  	: 0 - target is not the solution, 1 - target is the solution
'Response'  	: 1 - target is not the solution, 2 - target is the solution
'Confidence'	: 1 - I am guessing, 2 - I am not confident, 3 - I am quite confident, 4 - I am very confident.
'RT_dec'		: reaction time of the response, NaN where no reaction was made.
'RT_conf' 		: reaction time for the confidence decision.
'Condition'		: describes the order of responses participants made (1 - MtD, 2 - tDM, 3 - tMD, please see details in the paper).
'Accuracy'		: 0 - incorrect response, 1 - correct response.
'Trial'			: number of the trial.
'Block'			: 0 -training, 1 - first block, 2 - second block (both blocks were similar).
'Sol_letters'	: number of letters in the solution word.
'Tar_letters'	: number of letters in the target word.
'Sol_freq'		: frequency of the solution word in Polish.
'Tar_freq'		: frequency of the target word in Polish.
'Letter_changed': number of letters changed between the solution and the target.
