Stimulus Details:
Difficulty:
   Motion coherence
   Four coherence levels presented within each block (0.032, 0.064, 0.128, 0.256)
   The dot generation algorithm employed in this study was based on that of Shadlen and Newsome (2001) and programmed using PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007).
Stimulus: 1 is rightwards, 0 left
Response: 1 is rightwards, 0 left, TIMEOUT indicate no response within 5s
Accuracy: 1 is correct

Confidence scale: 
10-20-30-40-50 (signed positive or negative)
Post-Decision Wager (bi-directional)
On choosing a direction, participants were required to gamble 10 to 50 points 
on either the direction they chose or the opposite direction using a drop-down menu. 
If the correct direction was chosen, a participant gained the chosen points, and if they chose the incorrect direction, the same number of points was deducted from their accumulated score. Participants were told at the beginning of the experiment that the aim was to earn as many points as possible by the end of the session. Upon making a number selection, a feedback stimulus appeared on the screen informing subjects whether they had answered correctly and the number of points won or lost.
In the data, wagers that were opposite to the response are negative scores
(e.g., gambling 10 points that right is correct after choosing left is scored as -10)

Manipulations: 
All participants were required to respond within 5 seconds (Timeout)

Block size: 48 trials, 10 Blocks

Feedback: Included

Training: 1 is practice, 0 is not

Additional Information

Subject population: 
Twenty-five university students from NUI Galway were randomly recruited through an online system called SONA. Nineteen (76%) females and six (24%) males participated in this study. Their age ranged from 18 to 31 years.  All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision. 

Response device: Mouse

Exclude subjects: The variable, exclude_subj, indicate subjects recommended to be excluded since they did not complete all 492 trials.

Experiment setting: Laboratory. 
Participants' eye movements were tracked so they rested their head on chinrest.
The chin-rest was 80cm away from the monitor and 70cm from the eye-tracker. 
The task was performed on a 23 inches screen with the resolution of 1080p and 144Hz refresh rate. The stimuli were displayed on at 3 degree of visual angle. 

Experiment goals: 
(1) Investigate mouse and eye movement during perceptual decisions
(2) Does motivation improve decision accuracy (knowing they can earn more by being accurate)

Main result: Mouse cursor deflection provides additional information on decision processes
Gamble changes-of-mind did not improve accuracy

Experiment dates: Jan-March 2019

Location of data collection: NUI Galway, Ireland
