Stimulus: A motion perception protocol was used in which a period of adaptation to non-coherent motion (random noise) was followed with a test stimulus of varied coherence. Participants gave a binary forced-choice direction categorisation followed by a binary confidence response. 

Confidence scale: Participants made sequential decision-confidence responses. Both responses were binary forced choice (1=Left/Right motion, 2=High/Low confidence). Responses were coded as Leftward (Response = 0) or Rightward (Response = 1). Confidence was scored as Low confidence (Confidence = 0) or High confidence (Confidence = 1).

Manipulations: Participants adapted to a non-coherent motion stimulus around fixation. Ps then provided a categorisation of a subsequent test stimulus with varying motion coherence (0%-30%, randomised). Participants were additionally provided with a cue, informing them to default their uncertain guesses to either the left (Condition = -1) or right direction (condition = 1). The cue direction was randomised within blocks and statistical comparisons were fully within subjects. Additionally, participants were requested to default to the direction of the cue (Exp 2a) or the direction opposite the cue (Exp 2b) to simulate the effect of attractive and contrastive motion aftereffects.
No reaction time data were recorded for this experiment (judgments were untimed). I have not included these variables. 

Block size: The test stimuli consisted of 11 coherence values presented 10 times each, repeated for each of the instruction conditions (Left default and Right default) totalling 220 stimulus observations in Experiment 2. 

Feedback: Participants received no trial-by-trial feedback.

Subject population: No demographic details were recorded.

Response device: Keyboard directional arrows (L/R response, Up/Down confidence).
Experimental setting: In lab, supervised by experimenter.
Special instructions: Judge the appearance of the stimulus, and report high or low confidence. 

Experiment dates: 2016-2017.
