Stimulus
Gabor patch embedded in noise. The Gabor patches were oriented at 45 degrees away from vertical. 1: left (counterclockwise) orientation, 2: right (clockwise) orientation.Confidence scale
4-point scale: Subjects were required to report their estimated certainty from 1 (chance) to 4 (perfectly sure). Confidence was given with the same button press as the decision.Manipulations
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to different brain areas - S1, DLPFC, or aPFC. TMS was delivered on each trial as a train of three pulses delivered 250, 350, and 450 ms after stimulus onset. The site to stimulate was chosen pseudo-randomly before each block such that all the three sites were stimulated once within each run (each run consisted of three blocks) 1: S1, 2: DLPFC, 3: aPFC.Block size
40. Each subject came for 2 days and completed 4 runs of 3 blocks each. First run of each session was a short practice run included to accustom subjects to receiving TMS. These trials were not analyzed and are not included in the file. Subjects completed a total of 720 trials in the main experiment.
Feedback
No trial-by-trial feedback was provided except during training.
Subject population
Young adults (18-32 years old). N = 19 (includes 1 subject originally excluded in the paper because of failed TMS delivery)Response device
Computer keyboard.Training
Given on Day 1. 5 blocks of training with feedback followed by 3-down-1-up stair-casing to set the stimulus contrast value for the experiment. Experiment goal
Examine the effect of TMS to prefrontal sites on confidence and metacognition. 

Main result
DLPFC TMS decreased mean confidence without affecting metacognitive scores. aPFC TMS increased metacognitive scores for second half of blocks without affecting mean confidence.
