Stimulus
We used anagram task, so the stimuli were words. For the purpose of the study, 80 Polish nouns were chosen, each containing 7–10 letters. Forty of these words were made into anagrams by randomly mixing the order of the letters. Then, to each of those 40 words we matched one other word that contained almost the same letters, but in different order. Sometimes letters were added or changed in one word in a pair. Thirty pairs differed also by 1 letter that was added or changed (in English this could be: SENATOR–TOASTER), 9 pairs differed by 2 letters that were either added or changed (e.g., RESTAURANT–TRANSLATOR), and one pair differed in 3 letters which had been either exchanged or added. The list of anagrams to solve was the same for all participants but different solutions (i.e., correct or incorrect) were suggested. 

Confidence scale
We used a confidence scale to measure participants’ confidence in their decisions (“How confident are you that you will make the right decision?” or “How confident are you that you made the right decision?”). The answers were: “I am guessing”, “I am not confident”, “I am quite confident”, and “I am very confident”. 

Manipulations
Participants were asked to solve anagrams and then decide whether a presented target word was or was not the anagram solution. In addition participants rated their confidence. We manipulated the order of response and confidence rating and the presence of motor response. We had 3 between-subject conditions. In the Overt-decision condition, participants immediately after seeing a target word expressed their decision with a motor response and then rated their confidence in that response. In the Covert-decision condition, participants were asked to decide before rating their confidence, but they carried out the motor response afterwards (however they were asked to signal when they decide about the target). In the No-decision condition, participants were first asked to rate their confidence and then to respond to the anagram task. 

Block size
There was one block with 40 anagrams.

Feedback
Participants received no feedback.

NaN fields
NaN's in Response, RT_response, Confidence, RT_Conf, RT_coveresp (condition 3) and response_key columns are due to participants not making the reaction in time provided. NaN in RT_covresp column, in conditions 1 and 2 are due to the conditions itself - we did not ask participants in those groups to make covert decisions. 

Subject population
One hundred and forty-three participants, 30 males, aged 19–28 (M = 21.31, SD = 1.78) 

Response device
Computer keyboard.

Experiment goal
We compared metacognitive accuracy between all three conditions. We expected that metacognitive accuracy would be higher when confidence ratings follow a Covert decision (decision without motor response) compared to the No-decision condition; this would indicate that the results of the decision-making process provide crucial information for confidence judgments. However, if decisions have to be carried out to affect metacognitive accuracy, this parameter should be higher in the Overt-decision condition than in the other two conditions. 

Main result
The results showed a significant relationship between decision accuracy and confidence level in each condition; however, this relation was stronger when the confidence rating followed the covert or overt decision compared to No-decision condition.

Fields in the .csv file: 

'Subj_idx': subject identification number (1 to 143).
'Stimulus': 0 - target word was not anagram's solution; 1 - target was anagram's solution.
'Response': 0 - target word was not anagram's solution, 1 - target was anagram's 			solution (as participants declared), NaN - lack of response 
'Confidence': 1 - I am guessing, 2 - I am not confident, 3 - I am quite confident, 4 - I 		am very confident, NaN - lack of response
'RT_dec': reaction time of the response, NaN - lack of response
'RT_conf': reaction time for the confidence decision, NaN - lack of response
"Difficulty": types of differences between and anagram and target word, 3 - none, 2 - letter changed, 1 - letter added, 0 - letter changed and added  (0-3 from easiest to most difficult)
'Condition': 1 - Overt decision, 2 - No decision, 3 - Covert decision
'Accuracy': 0 - incorrect response, 1 - correct response
'Response_key': the actual key participant pressed to respond ('o' or 'p')
'Solution': a word that was a correct solution to the anagram.
'Target': a word that was presented to participant (to decide whether it in the anagram's solution)
'Type_of_changes': whether letters were changed or added to the target word compared to the 			anagram 
'RT_covresp': response time of covert decision (see: Manipulations), measured only in condition 3
Trial:	3-42 (the first two were training trials)
Sol_letters: number of letters in solution
Target_letters: number of letters in target
