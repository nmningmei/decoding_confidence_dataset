Category: Visual perception

Stimulus: 

On each trial, participants were required to discriminate the orientation of a brief, masked Gabor, presented at the threshold of visual awareness. Left tilted stimuli are coded as 1 and right tilted as 2. Left tilted responses are coded as 1 and right tilted responses as 2. In addition, prior to the discrimination response, participants were asked to report on the state of visual awareness of the stimulus. Following the discrimination response, they also rated the confidence in the correctness of the discrimination response.


Confidence scale: 

Both awareness and confidence reports were collected on each trial.

Regarding the awareness response, participants were asked to report whether they were aware or unaware of the Gabor orientation; 'unaware' responses are coded as 1 and 'aware' responses are coded as '2'. 

Regarding the confidence response, Experiment 1 employed a 1-3 scale to rate the level of confidence with higher levels coded with a higher number.  

Manipulations: None

Feedback: No

NaN fields: There were no response deadlines and all answers were recorded. There should be no NaNs. 

Block size:  We intended to run 10 blocks of 50 trials each per participant. However, one subject could only complete 9 blocks. Also, the last trial of the last block is missing in one subject, likely due to a Psychopy issue related to the generation of the csv data file.

Trial count: Please note this starts with 0, so 0 is trial 1.

Subject population: Participants were healthy volunteers aged between 22 and 30 years.  

Response device: Keyboard.

Experiment setting: Laboratory.

Training: There was a short practice with visible stimuli to familiarise participants with the discrimination task. A calibration phase of the luminance of the Gabor followed. Then, participants performed 30 training trials in the actual experimental task.

Experiment goal: To assess the extent to which type-1 (perceptual) and type-2 (metacognitive) sensitivity are dependent on the state of visual awareness.

Main result: The level of type-1 perceptual sensitivity was strongly related to the state of visual awareness, but this was not the case for type-2 metacognitive sensitivity.

Special instructions: Participants were instructed that confidence ratings should be conceived in a relative fashion and hence they were asked to use all the confidence ratings independently of the awareness rating so that participants would not simply choose low confidence every time they were unaware and vice-versa on aware trials. They were also instructed to respond as precisely as possible in all the three responses. There was no response deadline and speed was not emphasised.

Experiment dates: Data was collected between November and December 2013.
