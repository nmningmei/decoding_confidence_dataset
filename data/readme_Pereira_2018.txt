Confidence scale: continuous, subjects stop a slider moving up and down between 0 (sure I made an error) and 1 (sure I answered correctly)

Block size: miniblocks of 12 trials alternating an active (subjects make first order decision) and observed condition (subjects observe the first order decision, a replay of the previous 12 trials) 

Feedback: none

Subj_idx: the subject number
Stimulus: stimulus identity (1 ~ more dots on the left, 2 ~ more dots on the right)
Response: subject's response (1 ~ left, 2 ~ right)
Confidence: subject's confidence rating (between 0 and 1)
RT_decision: the decision reaction time (RT in seconds)
RT_confidence: the confidence reaction time (RT in seconds, not meaningful as the confidence scale has random starting point, see methods)
Ease: number of dots difference between right and left

Subject population: EPFL students (18-35)

Response device: fMRI button box

Experiment setting: fMRI

Training: 10 min prior to the experiment

Special instructions: respond in less than 500 ms
