Stimulus
2 Gabors were oriented 45 degrees away from vertical. 1: left (counterclockwise) orientation, 2: right (clockwise) orientation, 0: stimulus absent trial.
Note: The stimulus presentation is very similar with the figure 2 in Iemi et al. (2017). Basically we administered a signal detection task, not discrimination task. Hence, subjects were asked to indicate whether they saw a target (Gabor) or not, so the target absent trials were needed here. As for the different tilted Gabors in different blocks, subjects were not informed and couldn't differentiate according to oral debrief when experiment finished.

Side
In the target present trials, the Gabor was presented either on the left or right side of the fixation (8 degrees of visual angle). 1: left, 2: right, or 0: absent. Also see the figure 2 in Iemi et al. (2017).


Contrast
The contrast value is the intensity (log10) units in function Screen('DrawTexture') of PTB-3. The real value putted in the function was 10^contrast. The contrast was adjusted through QUEST procedure to maintain the overall accuracy around 75%.


Confidence scale
11-point scale bar: from 0 (completely guess) to 10 (completely certain). Subjects were encouraged to make unconfident responses (0-4) and confident responses (6-10) and try to avoid middle point 5. 


Manipulations
For each subject, different Gabors were associated with either their own name or their friend's name during the match learning session (e.g. left tilted Gabor - self, right tilted Gabor - friend). The condition code 1: Self and 2: Friend. Each condition was interleaved and presented in a block of 50 trials.  


Block size
50. Each subject completed 12 blocks with conditions alternating in consecutive blocks. The total trials will be 600 per subject.


Feedback
No feedback was provided in the main experiment.

NaN fields
Subjects were given 15 seconds in the confidence rating. If subjects failed to respond within this time period, their response was recorded as NaN.

Subject population
32 healthy adults (21-36 years old).

Experiment setting
Lab

Response device
Computer keyboard for type-1 decision. Mouse for confidence scale rating.

Training
40 trials practice with trial-by-trial color-coded feedback in detection task. Confidence rating was not presented in the training session.

Experiment goal
Examine the effect of self advantage effect on metacognition.
