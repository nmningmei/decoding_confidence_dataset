Stimulus: Random dot kinetograms; "coherence" is proportion of dots moving coherently

Confidence scale: 0 (certainly incorrect) to 100 (certainly correct), in 1% increments

Manipulations: 
  Coherence - 2/4/8/16% of dots moving in same direction
  Timing of prompt - 5, 750, or 1500 ms after an initial response, participants were PROMPTED to make their confidence response (NOTE: choice and confidence RTs are time after prompt it took to respond)
  Choice/No-choice - these are entered as separate datasets; the "choice" data set had separate choice and confidence responses (_ch file), while the "no-choice" dataset has them entered simultaneously (_nc file).

Block size: 24 trials

Feedback: Feedback was given after each trial about whether or not the response was correct and whether or not the confidence response was correct (because the paradigm allowed for reversals)

Participants: 9 Michigan State University students, 7 female / 2 male, 19-27 years old

Response device: Mouse; confidence responses entered on a radial scale by moving mouse to desired location (e.g., left = 0, up = 50, right = 100). Illustration provided in the paper

Experiment setting: Dark, sound-insulated individual testing booths

Training: 30 practice trials per session, including training on scale use and RDM stimulus

Experiment goal: To examine whether there were differences in distribution of confidence between choice and no-choice conditions

Main result: Confidence was more extreme (closer to 100%) in the no-choice condition than in the choice condition
