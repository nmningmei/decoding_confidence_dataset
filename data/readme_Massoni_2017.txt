Stimulus: Participants were briefly presented with two circles, each containing a number of white dots (50 vs 52).

Response: Participants were asked to select the circle that contained the more dots (left or right circle).

Confidence scale: The rating scale was from 0% to 100% with steps of 5%. Confidence accuracy is incentivized with an auction mechanism called probability matching (see Massoni, Gajdos & Vergnaud, 2014, Frontiers in Psychology, for details), such that participants have to report the most precisely and truthfully confidence as the probability of their choice being correct to maximize their earnings. There was no time limit for providing confidence ratings.

Difficulty: time exposure of the stimuli (1 = 850ms, 2 = 700ms, 3 = 550ms). Difficulty 1 and 3 in Study 1; difficulty 2 in Study 2.

Feedback: Feedback on accuracy after each trial in Study 1 (subjects 1 to 66) no feedback in Study 2 (subjects 67 to 120).

Manipulation: First part of a group setting study in which subjects first start in isolation and are unaware of the group component that will follow (data on group decision not provided in the database). Study 1 has feedback on accuracy and a between-subject difference of time exposure; Study 2 has no feedback and no time difference between subjects.
