Stimulus: A dual-task paradigm with central and/or peripheral stimulus detection. Stimulus_1 corresponds to the central stimulus (an array of 5 rotated letters) and is coded ‘same’ if all the letters were identical or ‘different’ if a single letter was different. Stimulus_2 corresponds to the peripheral stimulus. In Experiment 1 the peripheral stimulus was a randomly selected ‘male’ or ‘female’ face (from a pool of 64 possible faces throughout the experiment). Response_1 and Response_2 indicate the corresponding judgment for each stimulus type. Central and peripheral stimuli appeared on every trial (counterbalanced) but to avoid analysis errors I have coded the stimulus/response as ‘NaN’ if it was not task-relevant in the given block.

Confidence scale: Participants made a simultaneous decision and confidence rating. Confidence was rated on a 4-point scale from 1 to 4. Participants were instructed that a rating of 1 corresponded to a ‘complete guess’ and a rating of 4 corresponded to ‘absolutely certain’. No explicit verbal instructions were given for confidence ratings of 2 or 3 but participants were encouraged to use the full confidence scale.

Manipulations: In Experiment 1 there was one within-subjects manipulations: Attention. Attention was manipulated such that in the full attention condition (Condition_Attention code: ‘full_attention’) participants focussed on just the central (Task code: ‘central_task’) or peripheral (Task code: ‘peripheral_task’) stimulus. In the diverted attention condition (Condition_Attention code: ‘diverted_attention’) participants focussed on both stimuli at once (Task code: ‘dual_tasks’). Participants were instructed about the attention condition at the beginning of each block. NB. all trials were ‘whole_report’ in Experiment 1 (that is, participants responded to first the central stimulus then the peripheral stimulus on each trial in the diverted attention condition.

Block size: In Experiment 1 each block was 48 trials in length. Each participant completed 4 training blocks and 24 experimental blocks.

Feedback: Participants received no trial-by-trial feedback.

NaN fields: I have coded Stimulus/Response/Confidence/etc cells ‘NaN’ if the corresponding stimulus was not task-relevant in a given block. Unfortunately, no reaction time data was recorded for either experiment (judgments were untimed). For completion sake, I have included variables for each task (RT_decConf_1 and RT_decConf_2) but coded them NaN. In ‘partial_report’ blocks I have coded the unreported stimulus as NaN.

Subject population: Age range 18-38. Several participants completed both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. To highlight this I have used the same coding for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 (data_Matthews_2018_exp2.csv).

Response device: Mouse.

Experimental setting: In lab supervised by experimenter.

Special instructions: Subjects were encouraged to use the full confidence scale.
