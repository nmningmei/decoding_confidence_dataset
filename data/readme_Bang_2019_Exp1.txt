Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 148(3):437-452.The dataset comes from Experiment 1.StimulusSubjects performed 2-interval forced choice (2IFC) orientation detection task. Two stimuli – a target consisting of a noisy Gabor patch of a particular orientation and a non-target consisting of pure noise - were presented in a temporal sequence. In the ‘Stimulus’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates the interval where the target appeared. For example, 1 means that the target appeared on the first interval and 2 means that the target appeared on the second interval. ResponseIn the ‘Response’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1 or 2) indicates the interval that the subject reported as to where the target appeared.ConfidenceConfidence rating using a 4-point scale was used.ManipulationsThe difficulty of the task was manipulated via signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) of the target stimulus. In the ‘SN’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding indicates the S/N ratio of the target stimulus. The lower the S/N ratio, the harder the task was. DayThis experiment consisted of 7 separate days of testing. Day 1 was a pre-training baseline test session. Days 2-6 were training. Day 7 was a post-training test session. In the ‘Day’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1-7) indicates the session number. AccuracyIn the ‘Accuracy’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (0-1) indicates incorrect/correct response. ConditionIn the 2IFC orientation detection task, we used 2 orientations (trained and untrained orientations) and 2 quadrants (trained and untrained quadrants) in order to make 3 additional conditions. In the ‘Condition’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1-3) indicates the condition number. Condition 1 indicates that the Gabor had trained orientation and appeared within trained quadrant (trained orientation, trained quadrant). Condition 2 indicates that the Gabor had untrained orientation and appeared within trained quadrant (untrained orientation, trained quadrant). Condition 3 indicates that the Gabor had trained orientation and appeared within untrained quadrant (trained orientation, untrained quadrant). On sessions 1 and 7, subjects performed the task in these 3 conditions. However, during sessions 2-6, subjects had Condition 1 (trained orientation, trained quadrant) only for the purpose of training.Block sizeEach block had variable size (staircase method). Each subject completed 12 blocks per session.In the ‘Trial_in_block’ column of the .csv file, the numeric coding (1-12) indicates block number. For example, 1 means that the trial was in the first block.FeedbackWe did not provide trial-to-trial feedback.
