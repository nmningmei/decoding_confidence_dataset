Stimulus:
Priming arrows that pointed either leftwards (L) or rightwards (R). 
These were preceeded by masked priming arrows that either pointed in the same direction (Congr) or the other direction (Incongr), as indicated by the column 'Congruency'.

Confidence scale:
"How much difficulty did you experience when responding to the arrow?"
Easy: 'Rather less difficulty'
Diff: 'Rather more difficulty' 

Manipulations
Trials were either congruent or incongruent, as explained in the stimulus section. 

Block size:
Training 1: 20 trials
Training 2: 20 trials
Main: 8 blocks of 80 trials

*Note* due to an EEG recording issue, the experiment was restarted for participant 31, who (after the restart) only performed two practice trials and all main trials.

Feedback:
Feedback was only presented during Training 1

#other#
NaN fields:
RTs slower than 3s were not recorded

Subject population:
University students (Mean age 24.3 years, sd = 5.2, range 19-42)

Response device:
qwerty keyboard

Experiment setting:
Individual booth

Training:
See above

Experiment goal:
Show that i) stimulus (in)congruency affects subjective difficulty ratings, even though the primes were presented subliminally, while recording EEG

Main result:
see paper

Special instructions:
'Try to be as fast and accurate as possible' and 'try to use confidence responses equally often'

Experiment dates:
July 2013

EEG lab, Essex University, Essex, UK (English)
