Stimulus: 
2AFC design.
Stimuli were extracted from an action-adventure video game (Beyond: Two Souls), which was created by the French game developer Quantic Dream and played in the PlayStation 4 video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. 
For the memory task, we selected static images from the subject-specific recorded videos which the participants had played the day before. Each second in the video consisted of 29.97 static images (frames). The difficulty column is the temporal distance between two images (unit: frames). 
For the perceptual task, the same sets of subject-specific stimuli from the memory task were used. The difficulty column is the resolution difference, ranging from 0 to 1.

Confidence scale:
4-point scale: "Very Low", "Low", "High", "Very High".

Manipulations:
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to two different brain areas. TMS was delivered to either the precuneus or vertex before the task. 1: precuneus, 2:vertex. 

Task: 
Each subject completed two tasks, perception task and memory task. 

Block size:
60 trials per block. A total of 960 trials were presented(2 tasks * 2 TMS sessions * 4 blocks * 60 trials per block).

Feedback:
No trial-by-trial feedback was provided.

NaN fields:
Subjects were given 3 seconds to report their confidence level. If subjects failed to respond within this time period, their response was recorded as NaN.

Subject population:
18 young adults (19-24 years old).

Response device:
Computer keyboard.

Experiment goal:
Examine the functional necessity of the precuneus for metacognition in memory versus perceptual domains.

Main result:
TMS to the precuneus affects the metacognitive performance specifically for the memory domain.

Special instructions:
Subjects were encouraged to report their confidence level in a relative way and make use of the whole confidence scale.

Experiment dates:
Data were collected between May, 2016 and June, 2017.

Location of data collections:
East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.

Language of data collection
Chinese.
