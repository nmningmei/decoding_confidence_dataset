Stimulus
Indicates old/new status (1 = Old, 0 = New). 'Old' means that the item was previously seen on the study list; 'new' means that it was not previously seen on the study list.

Response
Indicates binary old/new response, which was extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Studied", 0 = "Not Studied".

Confidence scale
Indicates low, medium, or high confidence, extracted from response on the 1-6 scale used in the experiment. 1 = "Maybe", 2 = "Probably", 3 = "Definitely". The 1-6 response scale used by participants was as follows: 1 = Definitely Not Studied, 2 = Probably Not Studied, 3 = Maybe Not Studied, 4 = Maybe Studied, 5 = Probably Studied, 6 = Definitely Studied. The Raw_Response column contains the responses in this format.

Manipulations
Stimulus type was manipulated between subjects. There were four conditions. In the Paintings-Paintings condition, participants studied and were tested on recognition of painting stimuli in both the first and second study-test cycle. In the Paintings-Words condition, participants studied and were tested on recognition of painting stimuli in the first study-test cycle and word stimuli in the second study-test cycle. In the Words-Paintings condition, participants studied and were tested on recognition of word stimuli in the first study-test cycle and painting stimuli in the second study-test cycle. In the Words-Words condition, participants studied and were tested on recognition of word stimuli in both the first and second study-test cycle. Condition is indicated in the data file.


Block size
There were two study-test cycles separated by a 10-minute filler task. Each cycle contained 48 study items and 96 test items.

None.

Experiment goal
Determine whether response bias on the first test predicted response bias on the second test, whether the positive relationships observed with word stimuli would extend to tests using paintings, and whether the correlations would be stronger when the stimulus type was the same across the two tests versus when it differed.

Main result
There were significant positive correlations of bias across the two tests in all four conditions, though they were marginal in the Paintings-Paintings condition.
