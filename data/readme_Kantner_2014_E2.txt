Stimulus
Indicates old/new status (1 = Old, 0 = New). 'Old' means that the item was previously seen on the study list; 'new' means that it was not previously seen on the study list.

Response
Indicates binary old/new response. 1 = "Studied", 0 = "Not Studied".

Confidence scale
1 = Low, 2 = Medium, 3 = High. Confidence rating was entered immediately after old/new response.

Manipulations
None.

Block size
There were two study-test cycles, the first using faces as stimuli (38-item study list, 76-item test list) and the second using words (48-item study list, 96-item test list). The face study-test cycle came first, followed the viewing of 5 videos depicting crimes, followed by the word study-test cycle, followed by a lineup task.

Feedback
No feedback was provided.

Subject population
Undergraduate students.

Keyboard.

Training
None.

Experiment goal
Test whether recognition response bias on Test 1 would predict that on Test 2, whether average response bias across the two tests would predict lineup task performance, and whether average response bias across the two tests would predict response bias in Experiment 1 from the same paper (Kantner & Lindsay, 2014), for those participants completing both experiments.

Main result
There were significant positive correlations of recogntion response bias across the two tests and between this experiment and Experiment 1 (among participants completing both experiments). Response bias on the face recogntion task significantly predicted the number of suspects chosen in the lineup task.
