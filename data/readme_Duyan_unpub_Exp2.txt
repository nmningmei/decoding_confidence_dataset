Stimulus: There were three target lengths (7.5, 11.5 and 16.5 centimeters) which were randomly ordered across trials. Each trial began with the presentation of a target line at a random location. Then, the reproduction line, which was initially .25 centimeters, was presented at the center of the screen. The participants had to adjust the length of the reproduced line via left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to shorten or elongate it. Subjects then rated confidence on a 1-3 scale. They were then immediately asked whether they undershot or overshot the target (ErrorDirectionJudgment = "-1" [undershot] or "1" [overshot]). The "Stimulus" column indicates the number of pixels of different target lengths. "Response" variable shows the length of the reproduced line in pixels. "Error" variable shows the difference between the target and the response. The last two columns, trialFilter and MADfilter show the trials that were excluded from the analyses. trialFilter = 0 indicates that the participant did not adjust the reproduction line at all. MADfilter = 0 indicates that the reproduced length for that trial was 3 Mean Absolute Deviations above/below that participants mean reproduction for that target.


Confidence Scale: The scale was 1-3 with 1 = not confident, 2 = somewhat confident and, 3 = confident

Error Direction Judgment: -1 = undershot, 1 = overshot

Block size: Participants completed 2 blocks of 120 trials. The lengths were presented in a random order.

Feedback: No feedback was given during the actual task.

Training: No training prior to the task.
