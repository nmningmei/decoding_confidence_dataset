Stimulus:
A Gabor, titrated to achieve ~78% detection. Participants performed a Gabor detection task. The Gabor was presented in the periphery.
In the centre of the screen a visual search array was presented. On diverted attention trials, participants had to also report the
presence or absence of a target amongst distractors.

Stimulus coding:
0 = Gabor absent
1 = Gabor present

Confidence scale:
Binary confidence rating, where 0 means 'guess' and 1 means 'confident'.

Manipulations:
This was a 2 x 3 within-subjects design.
- Factor 1: Attention ( full, diverted )
            Under full attention participants ignored the central visual search array.
            Under diverted attention participants performed both the Gabor detection task and the visual search task.
            Attention was manipulated bloc-kwise

- Factor 2: Expectation ( expect target absent, control, expect target present )
            In 'expect target absent' blocks, 75% of trials were target absent trials.
            In 'control' blocks, 50% of trials were target absent trials (unpredictable).
            In 'expect target present' blocks, 75% of trials were target present trials.
            This was manipulated block-wise.
            Participants were informed of the most likely stimulus class at the beginning of each block.

Condition coding:
 - 1: Full attention, expect target absent
 - 2: Full attention, control
 - 3: Full attention, expect target present
 - 4: Diverted attention, expect target absent
 - 5: Diverted attention, control
 - 6: Diverted attention, expect target present

Difficulty coding:
Here, difficulty corresponds to Gabor contrast.
For each of the four conditions we had a running staircase to keep detection performance constant across trials.

Block Size:
12 trials per block

Feedback:
None

NaN fields:
 Either:
    - No visual search response given (because it was a full attention trial)
    - Participant did not respond in time

Subject population:
19 healthy subjects (19-34 years old, mean 25 years, 13 female)

Response device:
Keyboard

Experiment setting:
Lab

Training:
Approximately 5 minutes

Experiment goal:
Test for BOLD correlates of effects of expectation on decision and confidence criteria

Main result:
Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus BOLD (and functional connectivity to rIFG) is associated with the expectation-confidence relationship

Special instructions:
n/a

Link to material/codes:

Experiment dates:
2013

Location of data collection:
University of Sussex, UK

Any other important information about the dataset:
fMRI was collected while the task was performed.
For each subject, data was collected over 3 sessions ~24 hours apart.
