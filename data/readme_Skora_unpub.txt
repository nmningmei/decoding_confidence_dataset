Stimulus
Partial report change detection task with natural objects. Stimulus 0 - no change between the two arrays; Stimulus 1 - a change occurred

Confidence scale
Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS - Ramsøy & Overgaard, 2004). Standard categorical version from 1 to 4. Labels translated to Polish.

Manipulations
We used two types of cues: retro-cue and response-cue. We manipulated how far the object cued with response-cue was from the object cued with retro-cue. We arrived at 3 distance options (Condition): 1 - the same object was retro- and post-cued ; 2 - one of the objects directly neighbouring the retro-cued object was indicated by response-cue ; 3 - object cued by the response cue was further than direct neighbour from the retro-cued object.
Each condition had a different probability of occurring. Condition 1 - 45%; Condition 2 - 45 % (22.5% per each neighbouring object); Condition 3 - 10%.
This manipulation was within-participant.

Block size
Each participant completed 4 blocks of the task, each block consisted of 90 trials.

Feedback
No.

Subject population
Forty-one participant, 8 males, mean age = 23, sd = 3.4.

Response device
Keyboard. Left hand for scale rating and right hand for detection task.

Experiment setting
Group lab with individual booths.

Training
Fifteen trials of training with the task. Detailed instruction on the task manipulation.

Experiment goal
To test how does metacognitive sensitivity vary with the distance from focused attention.

Main result
The further the target is from the focused attention (specified as retro-cued object) the worse the metacognitive sensitivity. However, metacognitive sensitivity for direct neighbours is still better that we would expect based on d'.

Special instructions
Participants were throughly instructed on the specifics of the task manipulation and on the meaning of each scale rating category.
