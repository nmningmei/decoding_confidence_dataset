Experiment setting: Web-based.

Experiment goal: Recent work suggests that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is underpinned by a breakdown in the relationship between explicit beliefs about how the world works (i.e. confidence about states) and updates to behaviour. The present study aimed to test the precise computations that underlie this disconnection and ascertain their specificity to OCD symptoms.

Main result: Decreases in action-confidence coupling were not only associated with OCD symptoms, but also several other clinical phenotypes (6/9 corrected for multiple comparisons). This non-specific pattern was explained by a transdiagnostic compulsive symptom dimension. Action-confidence decoupling in high compulsives was associated with a marked inability to update confidence estimates (but not behaviour) according to unexpected outcomes, uncertainty and positive feedback.

Stimulus: The task consisted of a particle flying from the center of a large circle to its edge.

Response: Participants positioned a ‘bucket’ (a free-moving arc on the circle edge) in order to catch the particle - from position 0 to 359.

Data columns wrt response:
ParticleDistMean - Particle landing distribution mean
ParticleShoot - Where the particle landed
Response - Where the bucket was positioned
RT_dec - Bucket position RT

Confidence scale: Continuous confidence rating on 1-100 scale.

Manipulations: The probability of a change-point occurring on each trial was determined by the hazard rate. In the task, there were two hazard rate conditions that varied the number of change-points in a stretch of 150 trials each: stable (hazard rate = 0.025, 4 change-points), and volatile (hazard rate = 0.125, 19 change-points).

Block size: Participants completed 300 trials in total, divided into 4 blocks of 75 trials, with no explicit indication when a change in condition block occurred. Breaks were given between blocks which did not fall before the switch of a new hazard rate condition.

Feedback: Participants would see if their trial was a hit or miss.

Subject population: Sex and age of each participant is provided in the dataset.

Response device: Keyboard.

Training: Participants completed 10 practice trials that were excluded from the analysis and did not count for their final score. After the practice, they had toanswer 5 questions pertaining to the task. If they answered any of the questionswrong, they would be brought back to the beginning of the instructions and takenthrough the practice block again. Training data is not included in the dataset.

Task Resets: In order to reduce the number of participants failing to utilize the confidence scale properly, the task was reset to the beginning if participants left their confidence ratings as the default score for more than of the trials at the 20th and 50th trial mark. They would have to answer the task questions again before proceeding with the task.

Exclusion criteria in Seow & Gillan (2019): Participants were excluded if they failed any of the following: 
(i) In the behavioural task, the confidence scale indicator would always start at either 25 or 75 on every trial (Data column: ConfOri). Participants who left their confidence rating as the default score for more than 60% of the trials (n > 180 trials) were excluded. 
(ii) The task was also reset from the beginning if confidence ratings were left as the default score for >70% of the first 50 trials. Those who had their task reset >5 times were excluded. (Data column: TaskResets)
(iii) Participants who had more than 50% correlation between the default score and their selected confidence rating were excluded.
(iv) Participants with a lower mean confidence where the previous trial was correct than incorrect were excluded. 
(v) Participants who incorrectly responded to a “catch” question within the questionnaires: “If you are paying attention to these questions, please select ‘A little’ as your answer” were excluded. (Data column: QnTrap not equals to 1)
