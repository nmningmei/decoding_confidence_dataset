General information
Data are from a recognition memory study conducted in 2017-18 by Kaitlyn Fallow, supervised by D. Stephen Lindsay at the University Of Victoria. Participants studied 96 items (bookended by 3 primacy and 3 recency buffers) for 1 s each (with a 900-ms inter-stimulus interval including a 500-ms central fixation cross). Study instructions were simply to try to remember each item as well as possible for a later memory test. Following a ~5-min filler task, participants then completed a self-paced recognition test comprising all studied items and an equal number of new items, randomly intermixed. Data are complete except for one exclusion made due to an unusually long delay between study and test.

Stimulus
Indicates true old/new status (1 = studied, 2 = not studied).

Response
Participants' response collapsed into binary old/new variable (1 = studied, 2 = not studied).

Confidence scale
The Confidence variable in this file has been coded as 1 = maybe, 2 = probably, 3 = definitely to facilitate comparison with other datasets. Confidence and old/new judgments were made simultaneously on a 6-pt scale (1 = "definitely not studied", 2 = "probably not studied", 3 = "maybe not studied", 4 = "maybe studied", 5 = "probably studied", 6 = "definitely studied"); these original responses are included under Resp_raw for those preferring to work with data in this format.

Manipulations
There were no manipulations within this sample, but materials type is indicated in the Condition column to enable comparison with our other datasets. The Stim_idx column includes unique stimulus identifiers.

Block size
All participants completed 192 trials as a single block.

Feedback
No feedback was provided.

Subject population
Participants were undergraduate Psychology students at the University Of Victoria who participated in exchange for optional bonus course credit. Demographic data are not available for this particular sample, but the sample was drawn from a participant pool of mostly female-identifying individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 (~72% and ~79%, respectively, as of 2019; exact percentages may have differed at the time data were collected, but overall composition is roughly typical of previous years).

Training
None

Experiment goal
This experiment was part of an ongoing research line exploring materials-based differences in recognition memory response bias (see e.g., Lindsay & Kantner, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230305281_11; Lindsay, Kantner, & Fallow, 2015, in https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315752808). Here we sought to establish whether the conservative response bias consistently obtained in recognition memory studies using paintings as stimuli was also observed with complex photographs.

Main result
Response bias (c) was significantly conservative for these scene photographs.

Materials
Scene stimuli are available at https://osf.io/eya5x/, and were obtained from the FIGRIM dataset (http://figrim.mit.edu/; see Bylinskii, Isola, Bainbridge, Torralba, & Oliva, 2015, Vision Res), which contains a subset of images originally from the SUN database (http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/SUN/; see Xiao, Hays, Ehinger, Oliva, & Torralba, 2010, Proc CVPR IEEE).
