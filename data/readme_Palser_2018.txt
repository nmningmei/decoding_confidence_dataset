Stimulus: Coded as 1 or 2. Indicates whether pop-out Gabor was in first (1) or second (2) interval.

Confidence scale: Participants entered their confidence rating on a continuous scale of 1-99 using the laptop computer keyboard. Responses were not constrained by the program, and as such, there are a few responses greater than 99. These were discarded in our analyses. Smaller numbers indicate lower confidence and greater numbers indicate higher confidence.

Manipulations: The movement time of participants was manipulated using a feedback task interleaved between blocks of the perceptual discrimination task on which participants were rating their confidence. Trials marked as "Baseline" in the Condition column indicate trials that occurred before any movement priming. Trials marked as "Fast" occurred after feedback intended to train participants to move faster. Trials marked as "Slow" occurred after feedback intended to train participants to move slower. 

Block size: All participants completed four blocks of 50 trials.

Feedback: No feedback on performance was given.

NaN fields: There was a deadline on the response and so no answer was recorded.

Subject population: The age range of participants was 18 to 53 years (mean = 27, median = 24). All were healthy. Forty-four were right-handed and four were left handed. Thirty-one were female and seventeen were male.

Response device: Type I response was indicated by moving a marble from a homepad to one of two labelled touch-sensitive containers. The Type II response was indicated using a laptop computer keyboard.

Training: No additional training was provided. 

Special instructions: Participants were instructed to endeavor to use the entire confidence scale.
